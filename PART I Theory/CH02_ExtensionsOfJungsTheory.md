# Extension of Jung’s Theory 榮格理論的延伸

CHAPTER 1 PRESENTS the type theory in a less abstruse form than Jung employed in his Psychological Types and states the theory in terms of the everyday aspects seen in well-balanced people. In addition to their dominant process, such people have an auxiliary developed well enough to provide a balance between judgment and perception and between extraversion and introversion. Nowhere in Jung’s book does he describe these normal, balanced types with an auxiliary process at their disposal. He portrays each process in sharpest focus and with maximum contrast between its extraverted and introverted form; consequently, he describes the rare, theoretically “pure” types, who have little or no development of the auxiliary.  
第一章以比榮格在《心理類型》中所採用的抽象形式少的粗俗的形式提出類型理論，並以均衡的人的日常狀況來陳述該理論。這些人除了占主導地位的過程外，還具有足夠的輔助能力，可以在判斷和知覺之間以及外向和內向之間取得平衡。在榮格的書中，他都沒有描述這些正常，平衡的類型，並輔以輔助處理。他以最清晰的視角描繪每個過程，並在其外向和內向形式之間形成最大的對比。因此，他描述了罕見的，理論上“純”的類型，它們很少或沒有輔助劑的開發。(Google 翻譯)  

Jung’s approach has several unfortunate effects. By ignoring the auxiliary, he bypasses the combinations of perception and judgment and their broad categories of interest in business, people, language, and science. The results of these combinations -- the everyday forms in which the types are met -- are dismissed in seven lines on page 515 (see page 19 of this book). Consequently, other researchers, who have reinvented the categories under different names, were unaware of the parallels between their findings and jung’s theories.   
榮格的方法有幾個不幸的影響。通過忽略輔助因素，他繞過了感知和判斷以及他們對商業，人員，語言和科學的廣泛興趣類別的組合。這些組合的結果-滿足類型的日常形式-在第515頁的七行中消除（請參閱本書第19頁）。因此，其他以不同名稱重新發明了類別的研究人員卻沒有意識到他們的發現與榮格理論之間的相似之處。(Google 翻譯)  

Another serious result of ignoring the auxiliary process is the distorted descriptions of the individual introvert types. These types depend on the auxiliary for their extraversion, that is, for their outer personalities, their communication with the world, and their means of taking action. To portray them with no auxiliary is to portray them with no extraversion -- unable to communicate, to use their insights, or to have any impact on the outer world.  
忽略輔助過程的另一個嚴重結果是各個內向型類型的描述失真。這些類型取決於助教的外向性，即他們的外在個性，與世界的交流以及採取行動的方式。在沒有輔助的情況下刻畫他們就是在沒有外向性的情況下刻畫他們-無法交流，使用他們的見解或對外部世界有任何影響。(Google 翻譯)  

In view of Jung’s deep appreciation of the introverts’ value, it is ironical that he lets his passion for the abstract betray him into concentrating on cases of “pure” introversion. He not only describes people with no extraversion at all, but seems to present them as typical of introverts in general. By failing to convey that introverts with a good auxiliary are effective and play an indispensable part in the world, he opens the door for a general misunderstanding of his theory. Many people so completely misunderstood it that they took the basic extravert-introvert difference to be a difference in adjustment instead of a legitimate choice of orientation.  
鑑於榮格對內向型人的價值的深刻理解，具有諷刺意味的是，他讓對抽象的熱情背叛了他，專注於“純粹”性格內向的案例。他不僅描述了完全沒有外向的人，而且似乎將他們呈現為一般內向的人。由於未能傳達出內向的內向者有效而有效，並在世界上起著不可或缺的作用，因此他為普遍的理論誤解打開了大門。許多人完全誤解了這一點，以至於他們將基本的內向與內向差異視為調整差異，而不是對方向的合理選擇。(Google 翻譯)  

Few of Jung’s readers appear to have realized that his type concepts had a bearing on the familiar daily problem of educating people, counseling them, employing them, communicating with them, and living in the same family with them. For decades, therefore, the practical utility of his theory went unexplored.  
榮格（Jung）的讀者中很少有人意識到他的類型概念與人們日常的教育問題有關，即教育人們，向他們提供諮詢，僱用他們，與他們交流以及與他們同居。因此，幾十年來，他的理論的實際應用一直未被探索。(Google 翻譯)  

## Overlooked Implications of Jung’s Theory  

To be useful, a personality theory must portray and explain people as they are. Jung’s theory must, therefore, be extended to include the following three essentials.  
要發揮作用，人格理論必須刻畫並解釋人們的現狀。 因此，榮格的理論必須擴展到包括以下三個要點。(Google 翻譯)  

## Constant Presence of the Auxiliary Process 

The first requisite for balance is development of the auxiliary process in support of the dominant process. Jung does not mention the auxiliary process in Psychological Types until page 513, after all his descriptions of the types.  
平衡的首要條件是發展輔助過程以支持主導過程。 在對所有類型進行描述之後，榮格直到513頁都沒有在“心理類型”中提及輔助過程。(Google 翻譯)  

- In the foregoing descriptions I have no desire to give my readers the impression that such pure types occur at all frequently in actual practice. (1923, p. 513)  
在前面的描述中，我不希望給我的讀者留下這樣的印象，即這種純類型在實際實踐中幾乎經常出現。 （1923，第513頁）。(Google 翻譯)  
- In conjunction with the most differentiated function, another function of secondary importance, and therefore of inferior differentiation in consciousness, is constantly present, and is a relatively determining factor. (1923, p. 513)  
與最有區別的功能相結合，次要重要性的另一個功能，因此意識的較弱的區別，一直存在，並且是一個相對決定性的因素。（1923，第513頁）(Google 翻譯)  
- Experience shows that the secondary function is always one whose nature is different from, though not antagonistic to, the leading function: Thus, for example, thinking, as primary function, can readily pair with intuition as auxiliary, or indeed equally well with sensation, but … never with feeling. (1923, p. 515)  
經驗表明，次要功能始終是一種性質，儘管它並不不同於主導功能：例如，思維作為主要功能可以很容易地與直覺作為輔助功能相結合，或者實際上與感覺一樣好， 但是……從來沒有感覺。 （1923，第515頁）(Google 翻譯)  

## Results of the Combinations of Perception and Judgment  

The characteristics that result from these combinations, as outlined in Chapter 1, provide perhaps the most easily recognized aspect of type. All Jung writes about them is the following:  
如第1章所述，由這些組合產生的特徵可能提供了最容易識別的類型。榮格所寫的全部內容如下：(Google 翻譯)  

> From these combinations well-known pictures arise, the practical intellect for instance paired with sensation, the speculative intellect breaking through with intuition, the artistic intuition which selects and presents its images by means of feeling judgment, the philosophical intuition which, in league with a vigorous intellect, translates its vision into the sphere of comprehensible thought, and so forth. (1923, p. 515)   
從這些組合中出現了一些著名的圖片，例如實用的智力與感覺相結合，投機性智力憑直覺而突破，藝術直覺通過感覺判斷來選擇並呈現其圖像，哲學直覺與 強大的智力，將其視野轉化為可理解的思想領域，依此類推。 （1923，第515頁）(Google 翻譯)  

## Role of the Auxiliary in Balancing Extraversion-Introversion  

The basic principle that the auxiliary provides needed extraversion for the introverts and needed introversion for the extraverts is vitally important. The extraverts’ auxiliary gives them access to their own inner life and to the world of ideas; the introverts’ auxiliary gives them a means to adapt to the world of action and to deal with it effectively.  
輔助功能為內向的人提供所需的內向性，為外向的人提供所需的內向性的基本原理至關重要。 外向者的輔助使他們能夠進入自己的內心生活和思想世界； 性格內向的人為他們提供了一種適應動作世界並有效應對的手段。(Google 翻譯)  

Jung’s only allusions to this fact are cryptically brief. As a result, almost all his followers except van der Hoop seem to miss the principle involved. They assume that the two most developed processes are used in the favorite sphere (both extraverted or both introverted) and that the other sphere is left to the mercy of the two inferior processes. Jung writes:  
榮格（Jung）對這個事實的唯一暗示只是隱含的簡短。 結果，除了范德霍普（van der Hoop）以外，幾乎他的所有追隨者似乎都懷念所涉及的原則。 他們假定在最喜歡的領域中使用了兩個最發達的過程（既是外向的還是內向的），而另一個領域則由兩個劣等的過程所左右。 榮格寫道：(Google 翻譯)  

> For all the types appearing in practice, the principle holds good that besides the conscious main function there is also a relatively unconscious, auxiliary function which is in every respect different from the nature of the main function. (1923, p. 515)   
> 對於實踐中出現的所有類型，該原理都適用，即除了有意識的主要功能外，還有一種相對無意識的輔助功能，在各個方面都與主要功能的性質不同。 （1923，第515頁）(Google 翻譯)  

The operative words are “in every respect.” If the auxiliary process differs from the dominant process in every respect, it cannot be introverted where the dominant process is introverted. It has to be extraverted if the dominant process is introverted, and introverted if the dominant process is extraverted. This interpretation is confirmed by Jung in two other sentences, the first about the introvert thinker, the second about the extravert.   
操作性用語是“在各個方面”。 如果輔助過程在各個方面都不同於主導過程，那麼在主導過程內向的地方就無法內向。 如果主導過程是內向的，則必須外向，如果主導過程是內向的，則必須內向。 榮格在另外兩句話中也證實了這一解釋，第一句話是關於內向的思想家，第二句話是關於內向的思想家。(Google 翻譯)  

> The relatively unconscious functions of feeling, intuition and sensation, which counterbalance introverted thinking, are inferior in quality and have a primitive, extraverted character. (1923, p. 489)  
> 情感，直覺和感覺的相對無意識的功能抵消了內向的思維，質量較差，具有原始的外向性格。 （1923，第489頁）(Google 翻譯)  
>  
> When the mechanism of extraversion predominates… the most highly differentiated function has a constantly extraverted application, where the inferior functions are found in the service of introversion. (1923, p. 426)    
> 當外向性機制占主導地位時...高度差異化的功能會不斷外向化應用，其中內向性服務中會發現劣等功能。 （1923，第426頁）(Google 翻譯)  

The conclusion that the auxiliary process takes care of the extraversion of the introvert and the introversion of the extravert is confirmed by observation. In any well-balanced introvert, the observer can see that the extraverting is carried on by the auxiliary process. For example, ISTJ people (introverted sensing types preferring thinking to feeling as auxiliary) normally run their outer life with their second-best process, thinking, so it is conducted with impersonal system and order. They do not leave it to their third-best process, feeling, as they would have to do if both their sensing and their thinking were introverted. Similarly, INFP people (introverted feeling types preferring intuition to sensing as auxiliary) normally run their outer life with their second-best process, their intuition, so their outer life is characterized by spurts and projects and enthusiasm. They do not leave it to ehri third-best process, sensing, as they would have to do if both their feeling and their intuition were introverted.  
觀察證實了輔助過程照顧內向性和外向性的結論。在任何平衡良好的性格內向的人中，觀察者都可以看到，這種性交是由輔助過程進行的。例如，ISTJ人（性格內向的人傾向於以思考而不是感覺為輔助）通常通過其次優的思維過程來維持自己的外在生活，因此，它是以非人格的系統和秩序進行的。他們不會將其置於最佳狀態，即感覺，而不是內向和內向。同樣，INFP人（內向的感覺類型更傾向於直覺而不是感覺作為輔助）通常以其第二好的過程，直覺來維持他們的外在生活，因此他們的外在生活具有突兀，突兀和熱情的特點。他們不會將其留給ehri第三最好的過程，即感覺，如果他們的感覺和直覺都內向的話，他們將不得不做。(Google 翻譯)  

A more subtle kind of evidence lies in the “extraverted character” of the introvert’s auxiliary process. For example, in a well-balanced ISTJ the observable auxiliary process, thinking, can be seen to resemble the thinking of the extraverted thinker more than that of the introverted thinker. This point can be tested with any introvert by comparing the auxiliary process with Chapter 8. Figures 28-31, where the differences between extraverted and introverted thinking, extraverted and introverted feeling, etc., are shown.  
內向輔助過程的“外向性格”則是更微妙的證據。 例如，在一個平衡良好的ISTJ中，可以觀察到的輔助過程思維被認為更像是外向型思想家的思想，而不是內向型思想家的思想。 通過將輔助過程與第8章進行比較，可以用任何內向的觀點測試這一點。圖28-31顯示了內向和內向思維，內向和內向感覺等之間的差異。(Google 翻譯)  

Good type development thus demands that the auxiliary supplement the dominant process in two respects. It must supply a useful degree of balance not only between perception and judgment but also between extraversion and introversion. When it fails to do so it leaves the individual literally “unbalanced,” retreating into the preferred world and consciously or unconsciously afraid of the other world. Such cases do occur and may seem to support the widespread assumption among Jungian analysts that the dominant and auxiliary are naturally both extraverted or both introverted; but such cases are not the norm: They are instances of insufficient use and development of the auxiliary. To live happily and effectively in both worlds, people need a balancing auxiliary that will make it possible to adapt in both directions -- to the world around them and to their inner selves.  
因此，良好的類型開發要求輔助在兩個方面補充主導過程。 它不僅在感知和判斷之間，而且在外向和內向之間都必須提供有用的平衡。 如果無法做到這一點，就會使個人從字面上“失衡”，退回到首選的世界，有意識或無意識地害怕另一個世界。 確實發生了這種情況，並且似乎支持了Jungian分析師的普遍假設，即統治者和輔助者自然都外向或內向。 但是這種情況不是常態：它們是輔助工具使用和開發不足的實例。 為了在兩個世界中幸福而有效地生活，人們需要一種平衡的輔助工具，這將使人們有可能在兩個方向上適應周圍的世界及其內在自我。(Google 翻譯)  

## The Resulting Sixteen Types  

When the auxiliary process is taken into consideration, it splits each of Jung’s types into two. Instead of merely the introverted thinker, there are the introverted thinker with sensing and the introverted thinker with intuition. Thus there are sixteen types in place of Jung’s eight. Sixteen would be an unwieldy number to keep in mind if the types were arbitrary, unrelated categories, but each is the logical result of its own preferences and is closely related to other types that share some of those preferences. (The relationships can be visualized logically and easily through familiarity with the Type Table in Chapter 3, Figure 2.)  
考慮到輔助處理後，它會將榮格 (Jung) 的每種類型都分為兩種。 不僅僅是內向的思想家，還有內向的思想家和內向的思想家。 因此，有16種類型可以代替榮格的8種類型。 如果類型是任意的，不相關的類別，則要牢記十六個數字，但是每個類型都是其自身偏好的邏輯結果，並且與共享某些此類偏好的其他類型緊密相關。 （通過熟悉圖2第3章中的類型表，可以在邏輯上輕鬆地可視化這些關係。）(Google 翻譯)  

To attempt to determine a person’s type by observation, it is unnecessary to consider all sixteen possibilities at once. Any preference that seems reasonably certain will reduce the possibilities by half. For example, any introvert belongs to one of the eight introvert types. An intuitive introvert belongs to one of the four IN types. If such a person prefers thinking to feeling, the type is refined further to INT. The final step, identification of the dominant process, will depend on the JP preference.為了試圖通過觀察來確定一個人的類型，沒有必要一次考慮所有十六種可能性。 似乎合理確定的任何偏好都會將可能性降低一半。 例如，任何內向的人都屬於八種內向的人之一。 直觀的性格內向屬於四種IN類型之一。 如果這樣的人喜歡思考而不是感覺，則將類型進一步改進為INT。 最後一步，即確定主導過程，將取決於JP偏好。(Google 翻譯)  

## The Role of the Judgment-Perception Preference  

The JP preference completes the structure of type. As explained at the end of Chapter 1, this preference is indispensable for ascertaining which process is dominant. Students of Jung will not, however, find any reference to the JP preference in Psychological Types. Although he occasionally refers to judging and perceptive types among extraverts, Jung never mentions that the JP difference can be seen in introverts and that it reflects the character of their extraversion. This omission is inevitable because he never discusses the introvert’s extraversion.  

Instead, Jung divides the types into rational and irrational; the “rational” types are those whose dominant process is thinking or feeling, and the “irrational” are those whose dominant process is sensing or intuition. This distinction is of little practical use in ascertaining a person’s type. The rationality of the introverted feeling type, for example, is too interior and subtle for the observer to perceive with any certainty, or even for the subject to report. It is safer to depend on relatively simple and accessible reactions.  

The JP preference does show itself in simple and accessible reactions. It serves admirably as the fourth dichotomy if one detail is borne in mind: It deals only with outward behavior and thus points only indirectly to the dominant process of the introvert. The preference has three main advantages. It is easily ascertained; it is descriptive, embracing a number of conspicuous and important qualities; and it expresses a basic division in positive terms, without offense to either side. Both judging people and perceptive people can see merit in what they are, while to most people “irrational” is a fighting word.  

Inclusion of the JP preference in the theory came about as a result of unpublished personality research by Katharine C. Briggs before Jung’s Psychological Types was published. The type categories she had devised were entirely consistent with Jung’s, but less detailed. Her “meditative type” included all introvert types. Her “spontaneous type” corresponded to the perceptive extraverts, in whom perceptive behavior is at its strongest. Her “executive type” exactly described the extraverted thinkers, and her “sociable type” the extraverted feeling people.  

When Jung’s theory was published in 1923, she saw that it went far beyond her own, and she made an intensive study of it. Putting together the sentences quoted earlier in this chapter, she interpreted them to mean that the auxiliary process runs the introvert’s outer life. She looked at the outer lives of her “meditative” friends to see if this was true and concluded that it was.  

Briggs also found that when the introvert’s auxiliary was a perceptive process, it gave rise to a perceptive attitude and an outer personality that resembled, in a quiet way, the “spontaneous” personality of the perceptive extravert. When the auxiliary was a judging process, it produced a judging attitude and an outer personality that was the opposite of “spontaneous.”  

Her own understanding of the “spontaneous” types had prepared her to recognize the perceptive attitude and the judging attitude -- and the fact that they made a fourth pair of opposites. Inclusion of JP along with the other preferences, EI, SN, and TF, completed the system. The analyses she drew up at that time -- summarizing the effects of each of these four preferences -- provided, long afterward, the key to the practical determination of type.  


## Reality of the Opposites  

In all our subsequent work with type, Katharine Briggs and I have taken these four pairs of opposites as basic. We did not invent or discover them. They are inherent in Jung’s theory of the function types, which is based on many years of observations that seemed to him to synthesize already existing knowledge of personality. We have been less interested in defining the processes than in describing the consequences of each preference as far as we can observe or infer them, and in using the most accessible consequences (not the most important) to develop a means of identifying type.  
在隨後的所有類型工作中，Katharine Briggs 和我都將這四對對立作為基礎。我們沒有發明或發現它們。它們是榮格功能類型理論中固有的，它基於多年的觀察，在他看來似乎是在綜合已經存在的人格知識。我們對定義流程的興趣不如描述我們所能觀察或推斷的每種偏好的後果，以及使用最易獲得的後果（不是最重要的）來開發識別類型的方式感興趣。(Google 翻譯)  

Since the more superficial aspects of type are often the easiest to report, many trivial reactions are useful for identification, but these are merely straws to show which way the wind blows. They are not the wind. It would be a mistake to assume that the essence of an attitude or of a perceptive or judging process is defined by its trivial surface effects or by the test items that reflect it or by the words used to describe it. The essence of each of the four preferences is an observable reality.  
由於類型的更膚淺的方面通常是最容易報告的，因此許多微不足道的反應對於識別非常有用，但是這些僅僅是顯示風向的方式的稻草。他們不是風。假設態度，感知或判斷過程的本質是由其瑣碎的表面效果，反映其的測試項目或用於描述它的詞語所定義的，這是錯誤的。四個偏好中每一個的本質都是可以觀察到的現實。(Google 翻譯)  

It is easy for people to see that they have a choice of two worlds on which to concentrate their interest. One is an outer world where things happen outside individuals or “without” them, in both senses of the word, and the other is an inner world where the activity is within the individual’s mind, so that the individual is an inseparable part of all that goes on.  
人們很容易看到他們可以選擇兩個世界來集中他們的興趣。一個是在兩個詞的意義上事物都發生在個體外部或“不存在”的外部世界，另一個是內部世界，其中活動在個體的思想之內，因此個體是所有事物中不可分割的一部分。繼續。(Google 翻譯)  

It will be apparent to people, too, though perhaps more clearly as applied to others rather than to themselves, that people have a choice of two attitudes in dealing with the outer world. They can perceive it with no inclination to judge it at the moment, or they can judge it without making any further effort at perception.  
對於人們來說，儘管在對待他人而不是對自己的態度上可能更清楚，但對於人們來說也很明顯，人們在與外界打交道時會選擇兩種態度。他們可以立即判斷它，而不用花更多的精力去理解它。(Google 翻譯)  

When people consider their own mental processes, it will be evident that more than one kind of perception is possible. People are certainly not limited to the direct report of their senses. Through the subtle messages of intuition people can also become aware of what might be or can be made to be.  
當人們考慮自己的心理過程時，很明顯，一種以上的感知是可能的。人們當然不限於直接報告自己的感官。通過直覺的微妙信息，人們還可以意識到可能是或可以成為什麼樣。(Google 翻譯)  

Finally, people can see, at least in others, that there are two kinds of judgment, one by way of thinking and one by way of feeling. Everyone meets both daily, sometimes used appropriately and sometimes not.  
最後，人們至少在其他方面可以看到，存在兩種判斷，一種是通過思考的方式，另一種是通過感覺的方式。每個人每天都見面，有時會適當地使用，有時卻不會。(Google 翻譯)  

The existence of the opposites is thus nothing new, as jUng himself points out. They are common knowledge, once people stop to think about them. The difficulty is, Jung notes, that they look quite different to different types. People of each type experience the opposites after their own fashion. Even with “perfect” knowledge of all sixteen points of view, it would still be impossible to define the opposites in terms that would satisfy everyone. However, when people waive formal definitions and consult instead the reality of their own experiences, they can agree that in each of the four areas just mentioned there is a choice of opposites that may be experienced, however the dichotomies are defined.  
因此，正如容格本人指出的那樣，對立面的存在並不新鮮。一旦人們停止思考它們，它們就是常識。榮格指出，困難在於，不同類型的產品看起來截然不同。每種類型的人都按照自己的方式體驗對立面。即使擁有所有十六種觀點的“完美”知識，仍然不可能用滿足所有人的術語來定義對立面。但是，當人們放棄正式的定義而轉而參考自己的經歷的現實時，他們可以同意，在上述四個領域中的每一個領域，都有可能遇到的對立選擇，但是二分法被定義了。(Google 翻譯)  

The way insight by which jung synthesized such knowledge was the realization that an initial choice between these basic opposites determines the line of development for the person’s perception and judgment and thus has profound consequences in the field of personality. This magnificent idea makes possible a coherent explanation for the variety of simple human differences, for complexities of personality, and for widely different satisfactions and motivations. It also suggests an important new dimension in understanding the development of young people.  
榮格合成此類知識的洞察力是認識到，在這些基本對立之間的初步選擇決定了人的感知和判斷的發展路線，因此在人格領域產生了深遠的影響。這種宏偉的想法使得人們可以為各種簡單的人類差異，個性的複雜性以及廣泛不同的滿足和動機提供連貫的解釋。這也為理解年輕人的發展提出了一個重要的新方面。(Google 翻譯)  

Jung saw his theory as an aid to self-understanding, but the application of the theory (like the theory itself) extends beyond the point where Jung was content to stop. The type concepts shed light on the way individuals perceive and judge and on the things that they value most; the type concepts are thus useful whenever one person must communicate with another or live with another or make decisions that affect another’s life.  
榮格認為他的理論有助於自我理解，但是該理論的應用（就像理論本身一樣）超出了榮格滿足於停止的程度。類型概念闡明了個人的感知和判斷方式以及他們最重視的事物。因此，只要一個人必須與另一個人交流或與另一個人住在一起或做出影響另一個人生活的決定時，類型概念就很有用。(Google 翻譯)
