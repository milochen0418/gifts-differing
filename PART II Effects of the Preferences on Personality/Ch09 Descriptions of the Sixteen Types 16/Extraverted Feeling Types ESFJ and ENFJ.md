The extraverted feeling types radiate warmth and fellowship, and they have a vital need to find corresponding feelings in others and to meet a warm response. They are particularly warmed by approval and sensitive to indifference. Much of their pleasure and satisfaction comes not only from others' warm feelings but from their own; they enjoy admiring people and so tend to concentrate on a person's most admirable qualities.  
  
They are remarkably able to see value in other people's opinions, and even when the opinions are conflicting, they have faith that harmony can somehow be achieved and often manage to bring it about. Their intense concentration on other people's viewpoints sometimes makes them lose sight of the value of their own. They think best when talking with people and they enjoy talk.  
  
All their mental processes seem to operate best by contact. Van der Hoop says, "Their thoughts take shape while being expressed" (1939, p. 84). However, thoughts arising through and during the process of expression often seem lengthy and clumsy to a rapid abstract thinker. There is probably and advantage for lectures and orators in this blending of though with speech, but it hinders extraverted feeling types from being brief and businesslike, and it often slows them down on the job. They tend to spend a great deal of time in conferences and committee meetings.  
  
Their well-known idealism works two ways. They try hard to archieve their ideals, and they idealize those persons and institutions they prixze. In both instances, extraverted feeling types are bound to repress and repudiate everything in themselves and in others that conflicts with feeling; this proceeding gives rise to a lack of realism wherever feeling is involved. (The extraverted sensing types resemble the extraverted feeling types in their ease and sociability; but when faced by the same cold, inharmonious fact, extraverted feeling denies its existence, and introverted feeling condemns its existence, whereas extraverted sensing accepts its existence and lets it go at that.)  
  
Since the dominant process, feeling , is a judging process, these extraverted feeling types naturally prefer the judging attitude. It is not so much that they consciously enjouy settling things, as the extraverted thinkers usually do, but that they greatly like to have things are settled. They tend to regard the world as a place where most of the decisions have already been made. The desirability or undersirability of most varieties of conduct, speech, opinion, and belief seems clear to them, a priori. They hold these truths to be self-evident. Thus, they are likely to have an immediate valuation of everything and an impulse to express it.   
  
To have any validity, these judgments must be based on a well-developed perceptive process. If intuition is well developed as the auxiliary process, it will supply insight and understanding.  If sensing is well developed as the auxiliary, it will supply first-hand, realistic knowledge of life. Either can furnish genuine grounds for feeling judgments, but if neigher has been cultivated, there are no individual grounds to speak of.  
  
Extraverted feeling types without a balancing auxiliary have, nonetheless, an urgent need to base their feeling judgments on something. They have no recourse but to adopt the forms of feeling judgment that the community sanctions as suitable. Accordingly they adapt to the collective community, but their deficit of perception prevents them from adapting to other individuals.  
  
One very unperceptive extraverted feeling type, who was having a great deal of trouble with her teen-age children, was persuaded to try to suspend judgment and consistently use the perceptive, unjudging attitude with them. She reported, "It works like a charm, but it's the hardest thing I ever did."  
  
In the absence of adequate perception, the extraverted feeling types are prone to jump to conclusions and to act on assumptions that turn out to be wrong. They are especially likely to be blind to the facts when there is a disagreeable situation or painful criticism. It is harder for them than for other types to look squarely at things that they wish were not true; actually it is even hard for them to see such things at all. If they fail to face disagreeable facts, they will ignore their problems instead of finding good solutions.
