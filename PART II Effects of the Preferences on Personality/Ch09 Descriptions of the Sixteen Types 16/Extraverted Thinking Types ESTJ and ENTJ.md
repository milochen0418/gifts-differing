Extraverted thinkers use their thinking to run as much of the world as may be theirs to run. They are in their element whenever the outer situation needs to be organized, criticized, or regulated. Ordinarily they enjoy deciding what ought to be done and giving the appropriate orders to ensure that it will be done. They abhor confusion, inefficiency, half measures, anything that is aimless and ineffective. Often they are crisp disciplinarians, who know how to be tough when the situation calls for toughness.  

This might be called the standard executive type. There are other kinds of executives, some of them brilliantly successful. But it is doubtful whether any other type so enjoys being an executive, or works so hard to get to be one. Sometimes at an early age, a child of this type with systematic purpose and natural interest in running things, becomes, popularity aside, the leader of the school class.  

Much of the extraverted thinkers' effectiveness stems from their willingness to issue as strict orders to themselves as to anyone else. They stake out their objectives well in advance and put a lot of systematic effort into reaching them on schedule. At their best, they turn an unsparing eye upon their own conduct and revise whatever does not come up to standard.  

Extraverted thinkers natually prefer the judging attitude, and they act forcefully upon the basis of their judgments, whether well-founded or not. One of them wrote me: "Say something about the almost irresistible urge to make decisions, just for their own sake. Under this urge I will not only make quick and accurate decisions in my own field but will tend to make equally quick but faulty decisions in a strange field, just because I'm intent on decisions and do not take time to perceive the facts fully."  

Extraverted thinkers must develop a good perceptive auxiliary to give them grounds for judgments and must learn to suspend judgment long enough to give perception a chance. This might be difficult, but the rewards are substantial. Not only will better perception make their judgments sounder, but if they use it to see other points of view, it will help them in human relations, where they may well need help.  

Extraverted thinkers construct a code of rules embodying their basic judgments about the world. They aim to live by those rules, and consider that others should as well. Any change in their ways requires a conscious change in the rules. If their perception is not good enough to show them, from time to time, how their rules should be broadened, the code will be so narrow and rigid that it becomes a tyranny not only to the thinkers but also to those around them, especially their families. Everything that conforms to the rules will be right; everything that violates them will be wrong; and everything not covered by them will be unimportant. They will become, as Jung puts it, "a world-low whose realization must be achieved at all times and seasons ... Anyone who refuses to obey is wrong -- he is resisting the world-low, and is, therefore, unreasonable, immoral and without a conscience" (1923, p. 435)  

The basic mistake here is the infliction of one's own judgment on other people. Judging types should use their judgment on themselves, not on others. Thinking judgments are usually harder on the person judged than feeling judgments, because thinking is naturally critical. It analyzes, decides that things would be better if they were different, and usually says so, whereas feeling judgments tend to be complimentary part of the time. Feeling enjoys appreciating things. That may be too much to expect of thinkers in whom feeling is the least developed process, but thinkers can put it into their rules that from time to time they will use perception to see what there is about a person to appreciate -- and mention it.  

Against that background, any suggestions can be carried out with better grace than would otherwise be the case. Everyone likes to be treated perceptively, but it is especially important with subordinates, who cannot fight for their own viewpoints, and with children, husbands, and wives, who can do so only at expense of family peace.  

There is another reason why the thinkers should, for their own sake, practice the perceptive attitude. If they let thinking judgement dominate their every waking moment, their feeling will be too suppressed to be of any use to them. It may even acutely embarrass them at times by unexpected explosions of temper which consciously they would never "think" of committing. If they cultivate perception, however, by now and then turning off their thinking judgment, they give feeling a constructive outlet before it reaches the boiling point.  

Extraverted thinkers are convinced by reasoning, and when they are convinced, that is quite an accomplishment, because when they decide to do something, it gets done.  

## Extraverted Thinking Supported by Sensing  

ESTJs look at the owrld with sensing rather than intuition; hence, they are most interested in the realities perceived by their five senses, so they tend to be matter-of-fact and practical, receptive and retentive of factual detail, tolerant of routine, deft at mechanical things, realistic, and concerned with the here and now. Their thinking process appears deliberate, because it often is actual thinking, rather than the shortcut that is frequently furnished by intuition.  

The curiosity of an ESTJ is stirred mainly by new things that appeal directly to the senses --- now objects, gadgets or contrivances, new physical activities, new people, new houses, new food, and new scenery.  New things that cannot be grasped through the senses -- abstract ideas and theories -- seem less real and are much less acceptable. Anything intangible is rather distasteful, as it undermines the security of a factual world in which people can be sure of their judgments.  

The ESTJs solve problems by expertly applying and adapting past experience. They like work where they can achieve immediate, visible, and tangible results. They have a natural bent for business and industry, production and construction. They enjoy administration and getting things organized and done. Executives of this type prefer to base plans and decisions on established facts and procedures; they do not listen to their own intuition very much , and may need an intuitive around to point out the value of new ideas.  

This is perhaps the most traditionally "masculine" type and includes more men than any other.
