# Effect of the TF Preference 思考與情感偏好的效應區別

THINKING AND FEELING are rival instruments of decision. Both are reasonable and internally consistent, but each works by its own standards, Jolande Jacobi (1968) says that thinking evaluates from the viewpoint "true-false" and feeling from the viewpoint "agreeable-disagreeable." This sounds like a thinker's formulation. "Agreeable" is too pale a word for the rich personal worth of a feeling evaluation.   

The important point to recognize is that each kind of judgment has its appropriate field. To use feeling where thinking is called for can be as great a mistake as to use thinking where feeling is needed.  

Thinking is essentially impersonal. Its goal is objective truth, independent of the personality and wishes of the thinker or anoyone else. A seventeen-year-old introverted thinker, speculating on the method and purpose of the Creation, summed it up, "I don't care what the truth turns out to be -- but I want it to hang together." So slong as the problems are impersonal, like those involved in building a bridge or interpreting a statute, proposed solutions can and should be judged from the standpoint "true-false," and thinking is the better instrument.  

But the moment the subject is people instread of things or ideas -- and some voluntary cooperation from those people is needed -- the impersonal approach is less successful. People (even thinkers) do not like to be viewed impersonally and relegated to the status of "objects." Human motives are notably personal. Therefore, in the sympathetic handling of people where personal values are important, feeling is the more effective instrument.  

To hinkers, the idea of evaluating by means of feeling sounds flighty, unreliable, and uncontrolled, but thinkers are no judges of feeling. They naturally judge all feeling by their own, and theirs is relativesly undeveloped and unreliable. When feeling is well developed, it is a stable instrument for discriminating the worth of personal values, selecting as guiding stars those values that rank highest, and subordinating the lesser to the greater. When feeling is extraverted and directed upon other people, it not only recognizes their personal values but manages to convey its own.  

Thus, in teaching, in acting and the other arts, in oratory and in that humbler branch of persuasion called salesmanship, in the relations of the clergy to their congregations, in family life, in social contracts, and in any sort of counseling, it is feeling which serves as the bridge between one human being and another.  

The TF preference is the only one that shows a marked sex difference. The proportion of feeling types appears to be substantially higher among women than among men. This difference in the frequencies of the types ffor men and women has led to much generalization about the sexes. Women have been assumed to be less logical, more tenderhearted, more tactful, more social, less analytical, and more included to take things personally. All these are feeling traits. Feeling types (of either sex) will tend to have them. Thinking types (of either sex) will not. The generalization tends to pass over the women with thunking and the men with feeling, partly because types that do not fit the stereotypes have often leaned the art of protective coloration.  

The merits of the thinkers's logical approach to life are so obvious and so well known that it has not seemed neccessary to discuss them here. (They are treated in some detail in the individual descriptions of the thinking types in Chapter 9.) But it should never be assumed that thinkers have a monopoly on all worthwhile mental activity. They do not even have a monopoly on thinking. Just thinkers may attain, on occasion, a very useful supplementary development of feeling that does not interfere with their thinking judgments, so too the feeling types may sometimes enlist their thinking to find the logical reasons needed to win a thinker's acceptance of a conclusion they have already reached by way of feeling. Because the publication of a cherished piece of work, undertaken from motives of feeling and carried out intuitively, thinking may be used to check for possible flows and fallacies.  

Conventional measures of mental ability, such as intelligence tests and scholarship, show some of the very highest records belong to INFP and INFJ types, who relegate thinking to last place or next to last. The preference for thinking appears to have far less intellectual effect than the preference for intuition, even in some technical fields, such as scientific research, where its influence was expected to be most important.  

It would seem, therefore, that the mark of a thinker is not so much the possession of greater mental powers but having them run on a different track. Thinkers are at their best with the impersonal, and they are the most able to handle things that need to be done impersonally. The judge and the surgeon, for example, tend to rule out all personal considerations. One famous surgeon was so impersonal that his wife could not event focus his attention on his own children unless she took them to his office.  

Finally, thinking is not always first-class thinking, Its product is no better than the facts it started with (and they were acquired by perception of unknown quality) and no better than the logic employed. When a person who reportedly described logic as an organized way of goin wrong with confidence, he voiced the distrust of the out-and-out intuitives and the feeling types for such a cut-and-dried method of decision. When feeling types know that they value an idea or a person or a course of action, a thinker's argument designed to confute that value leaves them cold. The thinker's judgement could be wrong! Thinkers often contradict each other, each on claimming. "This is truth." The feeling type need only say, "This is valuable to me."  

The summary in Figure 26 differentiates the people in the outer columns of the Type Table from those in the middle columns. The traits mentioned are most evident in the EJ types, whose judging process is both extraverted and dominant and consequently most visible and emphatic. When the judging process is merely the auxiliary, it is subordinate to the perceptions of the dominant process and its manifestations tend to be more moderate.

這內容彷彿像是由百年前預言今日，它點出今日社會之迷思。 

若我們改從以依附理論來看現代社會中的個體們，個體所面對的難題普遍是，我們有自我，但是距離尋找自由的愛，卻存有一段不小的努力空間。 

這本書，也許它能夠帶給許多人更清晰的方向。所以分享之 www

其知名著
- 1941 - 逃避自由
- 1956 - 愛的藝術

這本愛的藝術，雖然是1956 的著作，但它對於今日 2020 的人類現況，確能夠有很好的解釋。將這本書一開始的截圖分享給大家。內容如下斜體字 
> 大部份人們把愛的問題認為主要是被愛的問題，而沒有想到去愛的問題，沒想到自己的愛之能力的問題。因此愛的問題在他們來說，是如何被愛，如何變得可愛。為了達到這個目的，他們遵循著幾條道路：其一 --- 這特別是男士們所應用的 --- 是變得成功，變得有權勢，有錢財，他的地位允許他在這些方面發展到何種程度，就盡量發展到何種程度。其二 --- 這特別是女士們所應用的 --- 是使自己有吸引力，採用的方法是打扮保養自己，考究衣裝等等。另一些使自己有吸引力的方法是男女通用的，諸如培養愉快的風度，有趣的談吐，能夠助人。客氣，不惹人生厭等等。許多使自己可愛的方式同用之於使自己成功的方式是相同的：就是要「贏得朋友及影響他人」。很自然的，在我們的文化之中，人們所謂的「可愛」，本質上只是「通俗」與「性感」的混合物。   
> 人們之所以抱著愛無需學習的態度，還有另一個前題，那就是人們認為愛的問題是對象的問題，而不是能力的問題。人們以為去愛是簡單的，尋找一個正確的對象，讓我們去愛 --- 或被他所愛 --- 去是困難的。這一種態度具有好幾個緣由，這些緣由又是源於現代社會的發展。緣由之一是關於「愛的對象」之選擇，在二十世紀發生了巨大的變化。在維多利亞時代 --- 以及許多傳統性的文化中 --- 人們多半不把愛當作個人自發的、過後才可能導至婚姻的經驗。相反的，婚姻是由習規所締結--- 或由雙方家庭，或由媒人，或則也可不用這兩種媒介；這種婚姻的締結是以社會性的顧慮及約束為基礎，並且認為婚姻一旦締結，愛情就可以自然發展。最近幾代，浪漫式的愛情觀念，在西方世界中幾乎可說成了普遍性的東西。在美國，習俗性的顧慮及約束雖然不是 ....  

[《愛的藝術》經典語錄（弗洛姆）]()

- 天真的、孩童式的愛情遵循下列原則：「我愛，因為我被人愛。」成熟的愛的原則是：「我被人愛，因為我愛人。」不成熟的、幼稚的愛是：「我愛你，因為我需要你。」而成熟的愛是：「我需要你，因為我愛你。」

- 愛情與成熟度無關。如果不努力發展自己的全部人格，那麼每種愛的努力都會失敗；如果沒有愛他人的能力，如果不能真正謙恭地、勇敢地、真誠地和有紀律地愛他人，那麼人們，在自己的愛情生活中也永遠得不到滿足

- 如果我愛他人，我應該感到和他一致，而且接受他本來的面目，而不是要求他成為我希望的樣子，以便使我能把他當作使用的對象。

- 最重要的是學會一個人單獨地待著，而且不看書、不聽廣播、不抽菸、不喝酒。有沒有集中的能力表現在能不能單獨地待著，而這種能力又是學會愛的一個條件。正因為我們不能自力更生，所以只能把自己同另一個人連在一起，這個人也許就是我生命的拯救者，但是這種關係同愛無關。

- 愛首先不是同一個特定的人的關係；它是一種態度，一種性格傾向。這種態度、性格傾向決定了一個人同整個世界的關係，而不是同一個「愛的對象」的關係。如果一個人只愛一個人，而對其他人漠不關心，他的愛就不是愛，而是一種共生性依戀或者是一种放大的自我主義。

- 非合理的信仰是指服從一種非理性權威的信仰，合理的信仰是紮根於自己思想或感情體驗的一種堅定的信念。

- 人們往往把這種如痴如醉的強烈程度當作是強烈愛情的證據，而實際上這只不過表明了這些男女先前是多麼地孤單、寂寞、無聊而已。

- 在成熟的人身上，我們可以看到一系列特有的態度：成熟的人能夠創造性地發揮自己的力量；成熟的人只想得到他自己為之付出勞動的果實；成熟的人放棄了全知全能的自戀幻想；成熟的人取得了一種以自己的內在力量為基礎的謙恭。而這種內在力量只能由真正創造性的活動所給予。

- 我們可以在母愛中間發現自戀的因素。因為她一直把孩子視為自身的一部分，所以母親對孩子的愛和痴迷可能是對自戀的一種滿足。

- 愛是對所愛對象的生命和生長的積極關心。如果缺乏這種積極的關心，就沒有愛。
