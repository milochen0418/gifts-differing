# Effect of the TF Preference 思考與情感偏好的效應區別

THINKING AND FEELING are rival instruments of decision. Both are reasonable and internally consistent, but each works by its own standards, Jolande Jacobi (1968) says that thinking evaluates from the viewpoint "true-false" and feeling from the viewpoint "agreeable-disagreeable." This sounds like a thinker's formulation. "Agreeable" is too pale a word for the rich personal worth of a feeling evaluation.   
思維和感覺是決策的競爭手段。兩者都是合理的並且在內部是一致的，但是每一個都是按照自己的標準運作的，Jolande Jacobi（1968）認為，思維是從“真假”的觀點進行評估的，而情感是從“同意-不同意”的觀點進行評估的。這聽起來像一個思想家的表述。對於感覺評價的豐富個人價值，“和A可親”的詞太蒼白了。(Google 翻譯)  

The important point to recognize is that each kind of judgment has its appropriate field. To use feeling where thinking is called for can be as great a mistake as to use thinking where feeling is needed.  
要認識的重要一點是，每種判斷都有其適當的領域。在需要思考的地方使用感覺與在需要感覺的地方使用思考一樣是一個大錯誤。(Google 翻譯)  

Thinking is essentially impersonal. Its goal is objective truth, independent of the personality and wishes of the thinker or anoyone else. A seventeen-year-old introverted thinker, speculating on the method and purpose of the Creation, summed it up, "I don't care what the truth turns out to be -- but I want it to hang together." So slong as the problems are impersonal, like those involved in building a bridge or interpreting a statute, proposed solutions can and should be judged from the standpoint "true-false," and thinking is the better instrument.  
思考本質上是非個人的。它的目標是客觀的真理，與思想家或其他人的個性和願望無關。一位十七歲內向的思想家對創造的方法和目的進行了推測，總結道：“我不在乎事實真相是什麼，但我希望它能夠團結在一起。”只要問題是非人為的，例如與建造橋樑或解釋法規有關的問題，就可以並且應該從“真假”的角度來判斷提議的解決方案，而思考是更好的工具。(Google 翻譯)  

But the moment the subject is people instread of things or ideas -- and some voluntary cooperation from those people is needed -- the impersonal approach is less successful. People (even thinkers) do not like to be viewed impersonally and relegated to the status of "objects." Human motives are notably personal. Therefore, in the sympathetic handling of people where personal values are important, feeling is the more effective instrument.  
但是，當主題是人們對事物或思想的不了解時，以及需要這些人的自願合作時，非人格化方法就不太成功。人們（甚至思想家）都不喜歡被人格地對待，而被貶低為“客體”的地位。人類的動機尤其是個人的。因此，在對個人價值至關重要的人的同情對待中，感覺是更有效的工具。(Google 翻譯)  

To hinkers, the idea of evaluating by means of feeling sounds flighty, unreliable, and uncontrolled, but thinkers are no judges of feeling. They naturally judge all feeling by their own, and theirs is relativesly undeveloped and unreliable. When feeling is well developed, it is a stable instrument for discriminating the worth of personal values, selecting as guiding stars those values that rank highest, and subordinating the lesser to the greater. When feeling is extraverted and directed upon other people, it not only recognizes their personal values but manages to convey its own.  
對於思考者來說，通過感覺進行評估的想法聽起來是輕浮，不可靠和不受控制的，但是思想家並不是感覺的判斷者。他們自然而然地憑自己判斷所有的感覺，而他們的親戚相對而言是不成熟和不可靠的。當感覺得到良好發展時，這是一種穩定的工具，可以區分個人價值的價值，選擇排名最高的那些價值作為指導星，並從小到大。當感覺外向並指向他人時，它不僅認識到他們的個人價值，而且設法傳達自己的價值。(Google 翻譯)  

Thus, in teaching, in acting and the other arts, in oratory and in that humbler branch of persuasion called salesmanship, in the relations of the clergy to their congregations, in family life, in social contracts, and in any sort of counseling, it is feeling which serves as the bridge between one human being and another.  
因此，在教學，表演和其他藝術中，在口頭上以及在那種卑微的說服力（稱為推銷手法）中，在神職人員與其會眾的關係，家庭生活，社會契約以及任何形式的諮詢中，這種感覺是一個人與另一個人之間的橋樑。(Google 翻譯)  

The TF preference is the only one that shows a marked sex difference. The proportion of feeling types appears to be substantially higher among women than among men. This difference in the frequencies of the types ffor men and women has led to much generalization about the sexes. Women have been assumed to be less logical, more tenderhearted, more tactful, more social, less analytical, and more included to take things personally. All these are feeling traits. Feeling types (of either sex) will tend to have them. Thinking types (of either sex) will not. The generalization tends to pass over the women with thunking and the men with feeling, partly because types that do not fit the stereotypes have often leaned the art of protective coloration.  
TF偏好是唯一顯示出明顯性別差異的偏好。女性中感覺類型的比例似乎明顯高於男性。男女類型頻率的這種差異導致了關於性別的廣泛概括。人們認為女性沒有邏輯，更溫柔，機智，社交，分析能力弱，並且更多地被個人認為是私事。所有這些都是感覺特質。 （兩性）的感覺類型傾向於擁有它們。 （任何性別）的思維類型都不會。泛化趨向於使女人具有沉思感，而男人則具有感覺感，部分原因是不符合刻板印象的類型通常傾向於保護性著色的藝術。(Google 翻譯)  

The merits of the thinkers's logical approach to life are so obvious and so well known that it has not seemed neccessary to discuss them here. (They are treated in some detail in the individual descriptions of the thinking types in Chapter 9.) But it should never be assumed that thinkers have a monopoly on all worthwhile mental activity. They do not even have a monopoly on thinking. Just thinkers may attain, on occasion, a very useful supplementary development of feeling that does not interfere with their thinking judgments, so too the feeling types may sometimes enlist their thinking to find the logical reasons needed to win a thinker's acceptance of a conclusion they have already reached by way of feeling. Because the publication of a cherished piece of work, undertaken from motives of feeling and carried out intuitively, thinking may be used to check for possible flows and fallacies.  
思想家用邏輯方法對待生活的優點如此顯而易見，眾所周知，以至於在這裡討論它們似乎沒有必要。 （在第9章對思維類型的個別描述中對它們進行了詳細介紹。）但是，絕不能假定思想家對所有有價值的智力活動都具有壟斷地位。他們甚至沒有思想上的壟斷。只是思想家有時會獲得非常有用的情感發展，而不會干擾他們的思維判斷，因此，情感類型有時也可能會吸引他們的思想來尋找贏得思想家接受其結論所需的邏輯原因。已經感覺到了。因為珍貴的作品的出版是出於感覺的動機並且是憑直覺進行的，所以可以使用思想來檢查可能出現的問題和謬誤。(Google 翻譯)  

Conventional measures of mental ability, such as intelligence tests and scholarship, show some of the very highest records belong to INFP and INFJ types, who relegate thinking to last place or next to last. The preference for thinking appears to have far less intellectual effect than the preference for intuition, even in some technical fields, such as scientific research, where its influence was expected to be most important.  
智力測驗和獎學金等傳統的心理能力測評顯示，某些最高記錄屬於INFP和INFJ類型，它們將思維推到最後一位或倒數第二位。對思維的偏愛似乎比對直覺的偏愛具有遠弱於智力的影響，即使在某些技術領域，例如科學研究，其影響被認為是最重要的。(Google 翻譯)  

It would seem, therefore, that the mark of a thinker is not so much the possession of greater mental powers but having them run on a different track. Thinkers are at their best with the impersonal, and they are the most able to handle things that need to be done impersonally. The judge and the surgeon, for example, tend to rule out all personal considerations. One famous surgeon was so impersonal that his wife could not event focus his attention on his own children unless she took them to his office.  
因此，看來，思想家的標誌不僅僅是擁有更大的精神力量，而是使它們在不同的軌道上運轉。思想家最擅長使用非人為因素，並且他們最有能力處理需要非人性化的工作。例如，法官和外科醫生傾向於排除所有個人考慮。一位著名的外科醫生是如此無禮，以至於他的妻子不能把注意力集中在自己的孩子身上，除非她把他們帶到他的辦公室。(Google 翻譯)  

Finally, thinking is not always first-class thinking, Its product is no better than the facts it started with (and they were acquired by perception of unknown quality) and no better than the logic employed. When a person who reportedly described logic as an organized way of goin wrong with confidence, he voiced the distrust of the out-and-out intuitives and the feeling types for such a cut-and-dried method of decision. When feeling types know that they value an idea or a person or a course of action, a thinker's argument designed to confute that value leaves them cold. The thinker's judgement could be wrong! Thinkers often contradict each other, each on claimming. "This is truth." The feeling type need only say, "This is valuable to me."  
最後，思考並不一定總是一流的思考，思考的結果並不比其開始時的事實要好（它們是通過對未知質量的感知而獲得的），也不比所採用的邏輯要好。據報導，當一個人將邏輯描述為一種有信心地犯下錯誤的有組織的舉止時，他就表示出對這種簡單易行的決策方法的直覺和直覺的不信任。當感覺類型知道他們重視一個想法，一個人或某項行動時，思想家為證明該價值而進行的論證會使他們感到冷漠。思想家的判斷可能是錯誤的！思想家經常互相矛盾，互相主張。 “這是真話。”感覺類型只需說：“這對我來說很有價值。”(Google 翻譯)  

The summary in Figure 26 differentiates the people in the outer columns of the Type Table from those in the middle columns. The traits mentioned are most evident in the EJ types, whose judging process is both extraverted and dominant and consequently most visible and emphatic. When the judging process is merely the auxiliary, it is subordinate to the perceptions of the dominant process and its manifestations tend to be more moderate.  
圖26中的摘要將“類型表”外部各列中的人員與中間各列中的人員區分開。提到的特徵在EJ類型中最明顯，其判斷過程既外向又占主導地位，因此最為明顯和強調。當判斷過程僅是輔助過程時，它就服從於對主導過程的理解，其表現往往更為溫和。(Google 翻譯)
