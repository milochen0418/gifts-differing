# Effect of the SN Preference 感覺與直覺偏好的效應區別

Anyone preferring sensing to intuition is interested primarily in actualities; anyone preferring intuition to sensing is mainly interested in possibilities.  
任何人喜歡感知而不是直覺都對現實感興趣。任何喜歡直覺而不是感覺的人都主要對可能性感興趣。(Google 翻譯)  

This preference is entirely independent of the EI preference. Intuitives do not have to be introverts. Their possibilities can be external possibilities, pursued in the outer world of people and htings. Sensing types do not have to be extraverts. They can be just as matter-of-fact in the world of ideas.  
此首選項完全獨立於EI首選項。直覺不一定是內向的。它們的可能性可以是在人與事物的外部世界中追求的外部可能性。感應類型不必是外向的。在思想世界中，它們可以是事實。(Google 翻譯)  

The sensing types, by definition, depend on their five senses for perception. Whatever comes directly from the sense is part of the sensing types' own experience and is therefore trustworthy. What comes from other people indirectly through the spoken or written word is less trustworthy. Words are merely symbols that have to be translated into reality before they mean anything, and therefore they carry less conviction than experience.  
根據定義，感測類型取決於其五種感官。任何直接來自感覺的東西都是感覺類型自身經驗的一部分，因此是值得信賴的。通過口頭或書面文字間接地來自他人的東西是不太值得信賴的。言語只是像徵，必須先轉化為現實，才意味著任何意義，因此，言語中的信念比經驗少。(Google 翻譯)  

The intuitives are comparatively uninterested in sensory reports of things as they are. Instread, intuitives listen for the intuitions that come up from their unconscious with enticing visions of jpossibilities. As stated earlier, these contributions from the unconscious processes vary from the merest masculine "hunch" and "woman's intuition," through the whole range of original ideas, projects, enterprises, and inventions, to the crowning examples of creative art, religious inspiration, and scientific discovery.  
直覺人士對事物的感官報告相對不感興趣。內向型，直覺型的人會聽取來自他們潛意識的，具有誘人的可能性的直覺。如前所述，這些無意識的過程所產生的貢獻，從最男性化的“預感”和“女性的直覺”到整個原創思想，項目，企業和發明，再到創意藝術，宗教靈感，和科學發現。(Google 翻譯)  

The common factor in all these manifestations of intuition is a sort of ski jump -- a soaring take-off from the known and established, ending in a swooping arrival at an advanced point, with the intervening steps apparently left out. Those steps arre not really left out, of course; they are performed in and by the unconscious, often with extraordinary speed, and the result of the unconscious processes pops into the conscious mind with an effect of inspiration and certainty. To the intuitives, these inspirations are the breath of life. The only fields that interest intuitives are those that give inspiration some play. They abhor the routine because it leaves nothing for inspiration to accomplish.  
所有這些直覺表現的共同因素是一種跳台滑雪-從已知和既定的基礎上飛躍而來，最後一躍而下到達終點，顯然沒有進行干預。當然，這些步驟並沒有真正排除在外；它們是在無意識中和無意識中進行的，通常以非凡的速度進行，無意識過程的結果以啟發和確定性的效果突然出現在有意識的頭腦中。對於直觀人士而言，這些靈感是生活的氣息。唯一吸引直覺的領域是那些能給人啟發的地方。他們厭倦了例行程序，因為它沒有任何靈感來完成。(Google 翻譯)  

Thus the innovator, the pioneer in thought or action, is likely to be an intuitive. In the early days of colonial America, the appeal of the New World's possibilities were probably felt so much more strongly by intuitives than by sensing types that it introduced a potent factor of selection. If the American colonies (and after them the Dominions) drew off a disproportionate share of the intuitives and left an unusually large majority of sensing types in England, some of the commonly attributed national characteristics might be explained. The solidity, conservatism, and dogged patience of the English, their love of custom and tradition, their unhurried addiction to afternoon tea and the long weekend belong to the sensing types, who know how to accept and value their world as it is. Our "American individualism," "Yankee ingenuity," and cult of "bigger and better" belong just as surely to the intuitives with their enthusiasm for what is just around the corner. The direction that the intuitives have imparted to our national life does not, however, mean that they are in the majority. Even in the United States the intuitives seem to make up only about one-fourth or less of the general population.  
因此，創新者，思想或行動的先驅者可能是直覺的。在美國殖民時代的初期，直觀人士可能比感覺到的類型更強烈地感受到了新世界的吸引力，以至於它引入了有效的選擇因素。如果美國殖民地（及其後的統治者）在直觀人士中佔了不成比例的份額，並在英格蘭留下了絕大多數的感官類型，那麼可能會解釋一些通常歸因於民族的特徵。英語的紮實，保守和頑強的耐心，對風俗習慣和傳統的熱愛，對下午茶的輕鬆上癮和漫長的周末屬於感官類型，他們知道如何接受並珍視自己的世界。我們的“美國個人主義”，“揚基的獨創性”和“更大更好”的崇拜肯定與直覺主義者一樣，他們對即將來臨的事物充滿熱情。但是，直覺主義者賦予我們的國民生活的方向並不意味著他們佔大多數。即使在美國，直觀人士似乎也只佔總人口的四分之一或更少。(Google 翻譯)  

The propoprtion of intuitives vaeries widely from one educational level to another. It is particularly low among students in vocational and general high school courses, and at least twice as high in academic high school classes, and still higher in college, especially in very selective colleges. A sample of National Merit Finalists was 83 percent intuitive. (To compare various samples, see Chapter 3, Figures 3-23.) The preference for intuition appears to conduce to the pursuit of higher education, but the difference may be as much in interest as aptitude.  
從一種教育水平到另一種教育水平，直觀知識的廣泛存在。在職業和普通高中課程的學生中，這一比例特別低；在高中課程中，這一比例至少是其兩倍；在大學中，尤其是在非常挑剔的大學中，這一比例仍然更高。全國優勝獎入圍者的樣本直觀率為83％。 （要比較各種樣本，請參閱第3章，圖3-23。）直覺的偏好似乎有助於追求高等教育，但這種差異可能與才智同樣重要。(Google 翻譯)  

Whether an applicant is admitted to a given college may seem to rest entirely on the admissions commitee's evaluation of the student's record, including grades and scholastic aptitude scores. Actually, for twelve years, the student has been casting a silent, unconscious vote whether to go to that or any other college. For example, after studying as hard as possible but without interest in academics, a student might not want four more years of school. This sentiment would be reflected in the student's grades. On the average, sensing children have less scholastic interest than intuitive children. (What might be done about this tendency is discussed in Chapter 13.)  
申請人是否被錄取到特定的大學似乎完全取決於錄取受託人對學生成績的評估，包括成績和學業成績。實際上，十二年來，無論是去那所大學還是其他任何大學，學生都在進行無聲無意識的投票。例如，在努力學習但對學術無興趣的情況下，學生可能不想再讀四年制。這種情緒將反映在學生的成績中。平均而言，有感覺的孩子比有直覺的孩子對學校的興趣要小。 （關於這種趨勢的處理方法將在第13章中討論。）(Google 翻譯)  

Sensing children also make lower scores on the average than intuitive children on intelligence tests and scholastic aptitude tests. It would be grossly mistaken but easy to conclude that sensing types are less "intelligent"; such tests do not take into account the legitimate choice between two rival techniques for the application of intelligence to life.  
在智力測驗和學業能力測驗中，有感覺的孩子的平均得分也比有直覺的孩子低。這將是一個嚴重的錯誤，但很容易得出結論，即感應類型的“智能”程度較低。這樣的測試沒有考慮將兩種智慧技術應用於生活的合理選擇。(Google 翻譯)  

The sensing child's native language is the reality spoken by the sense. The intuitives's native language is the word, the metaphor, the symbol, spoken by the unconscious. Most mental tests are of necessity couched in the intuitive's language. The sensing child has more translating to do, and translating takes time.  
感官兒童的母語是感官所說的真實。直觀人士的母語是無意識者所說的單詞，隱喻和符號。大多數心理測驗必須以直覺者的語言進行。有感測的孩子要做的翻譯工作更多，翻譯需要時間。(Google 翻譯)  

Although intelligence tests are usually speed tests for the sake of convenience, it is debatable whether speed has any rightful place in the basic concept of intelligence. Intuitives tend to define intelligence as "quickness of understanding" and so prejudge the case in their own favor, for intuition is very quick. The intuitive's technique is a lightning referral of the problem to the unconscious, which works very rapidly, and an immediate pounce upon the answer.  
儘管為了方便起見，智能測試通常是速度測試，但在智能的基本概念中速度是否有應有的地位尚有爭議。直覺者傾向於將智力定義為“理解的快速性”，因此以自己的喜好預先判斷案件，因為直覺非常快。直覺的技巧是將問題閃電般地傳遞給無意識的人，它的工作非常迅速，並立即撲向答案。(Google 翻譯)  

The sensing types are not in such close communication with their unconscious. They do not trust an answer that suddenly appears. They do not think it prudent to pounce. They tend to define intelligence as "soundness of understanding," a sure and solid agreement of conclusions with facts; and how is that possible until the facts have been considered? Therefore in reaching a conclusion they want to make sure of its soundness, like an engineer examining a bridge before deciding how much weight it can safely bear. They will not skim in reading, and they hate to have people skim in conversation. Believing that matters inferred are not as reliable as matters explicitly stated, they are annoyed when you leave things to their imagination. (Intuitives are often annoyed -- if not actually bored -- when you do not.)  
感應類型與他們的無意識之間沒有如此緊密的聯繫。他們不相信突然出現的答案。他們認為突襲是不明智的。他們傾向於將智力定義為“理解的聲音”，即結論與事實的肯定和牢固的一致。在考慮事實之前，這怎麼可能？因此，在得出結論時，他們想要確保其穩固性，就像工程師在確定橋樑可以安全承受的重量之前檢查橋樑一樣。他們不會在閱讀中略讀，他們討厭讓人們在談話中略讀。相信推斷出的事情並不像明確陳述的那樣可靠，當您將事情留給他們的想像時，他們會感到惱火。 （當您不這樣做時，直覺通常會使人煩惱-如果不是很無聊的話。）(Google 翻譯)  

Thus, a sensing child taking an intelligence test tends to read each question slowly and thoughtfully several times and, of course, answers fewer questions than the intuitive. Sensing people confirm this. An ISFJ, working in a personnel office that used the Type Indicator, was asked about her own technique for taking tests. She said, "Oh, I always read a question three or four times. I have to!" She doesnot have to in order to understand, but she does have to in order to be satisfied that she understands. So she goes slowly, and her slowness is the drawback. Some able sensing people manage to sacrifice their natural deliberation in taking tests, but it goes against their grain. An ISTJ psychologist, who had had an unbroken series of suprisingly low test scores until he came to his Graduate Record Exams, recalls he was so disgusted with his performance that he decided he could do not worse if he "raced through like an idiot." For the first time in his life, he scored high.  
因此，一個有智力的孩子參加智力測驗往往會緩慢而沉思地閱讀每個問題數次，當然，回答問題的人數比直覺的少。感性的人證實了這一點。向在使用類型指示器的人事辦公室工作的ISFJ詢問了她自己的測試技術。她說：“哦，我總是讀三到四次問題。我必須！”她不必一定要理解，但是她必須一定要滿足於自己理解。所以她走得很慢，而她的慢是缺點。一些有能力的人設法在參加考試時犧牲了他們的自然思考能力，但這違背了他們的意願。一名ISTJ心理學家在參加研究生記錄考試之前一直經歷一系列令人驚訝的低得分，他回憶起他對自己的表現非常厭惡，以至於他決定如果他“像白痴一樣競賽”，他的表現不會更糟。他一生中第一次獲得高分。(Google 翻譯)  

The choice between the two rival techniques of perception has a profound effect upon school work from the very start. Sensing children just out of kindergarten, with no instinct for symbols, are not likely to divine for themselves that a letter means anything beyond what it obviously is -- a shape on a page. If nobody explains to them what it means, they may still be seeing shapes on a page long after the intuitive children are seeing sounds, words, and meanings; and when they begin to read, they will seldom read for pleasure until they find a book containing facts they want to know.  
從一開始，兩種對立的感知技術之間的選擇就對功課產生了深遠的影響。感覺到剛從幼兒園出來的孩子，沒有對符號的直覺，就不太可能自己知道字母的含義超出了明顯的含義-頁面上的形狀。如果沒有人向他們解釋這意味著什麼，那麼在直覺的孩子們看到聲音，單詞和含義之後很長一段時間，他們仍然可能會在頁面上看到形狀。當他們開始閱讀時，他們很少會高興地閱讀，直到找到一本包含他們想知道的事實的書為止。(Google 翻譯)  

Often the sensing children are equally betrayed in the field of arithmetic. Before they start school, they need to get a soundly quantitative notion of number so that they know threeness as a quality for which three is a handy symbol; otherwise, in too many schools they will learn that "three" is a squiggle on the blackboard. They have a good eye and they learn their squiggles thoroughly. Presently they are told that when a twisted line called two appears beneath another shape called three, they must remember to put at the bottom a more complicated figure called five. They generally have a good memory, and they learn that. With flashcards and much drill, they learn by rote all the "addition facts" and "subtraction facts" about squiggles, but there is nothing inherent in the learning to make them suspect that the twisted lines mean anything. For many of these children, two-plus-three is entirely different from threeplus-two, and has to be learned separately.  
在數學領域，有感性的孩子常常被出賣。在開始上學之前，他們需要有一個定量的數字概念，以便使他們知道三性是一種特質，其中三是方便的象徵；否則，在太多的學校裡，他們會學到“三個”是黑板上的花招。他們的眼睛很好，而且他們會透徹地學習花式。目前，他們被告知，當名為“ 2”的扭曲線出現在名為“ 3”的另一個形狀下方時，他們必須記住在底部放置一個更複雜的名為“ 5”的圖形。他們通常有很好的記憶力，並且他們會學習。通過抽認卡和大量鑽探，他們死記硬背地學習了所有關於花體的“加法事實”和“減法事實”，但是在學習過程中並沒有使他們懷疑扭曲的線意味著什麼。對於這些孩子中的許多孩子，2加3與3加2完全不同，必須單獨學習。(Google 翻譯)  

The sensing children are accurate in simple computations as a rule, because they are more careful than the intuitives; but when they reach algebra or problems presented in words, many of them have difficulty in seeing what to compute. One twelve-year-old girl said of a percentage problem, "Here! I've done it all three ways, but I don't know which is right!" Most of the intuitive children, who understand symbols, recognize the meaning of figures in the beginning and are ready to work on the problems without too much difficulty. The constrast can make the sensing children feel stupid, which is discouraging.  
通常，有感測的孩子在簡單的計算中是準確的，因為他們比直觀的孩子更小心。但是當他們到達代數或用語言表達的問題時，他們中的許多人很難看到要計算的內容。一位十二歲的女孩說到百分比問題：“在這裡！我已經通過三種方式做到了，但是我不知道哪一種是對的！”大多數能理解符號的直覺兒童一開始就會意識到圖形的含義，並準備在沒有太大困難的情況下解決問題。約束會使感官兒童感到愚蠢，這是令人沮喪的。(Google 翻譯)  

Sensing types, of course, are not stupid at all -- but someone should have shown them the significance of numbers before they were six years old. If they are given the meaning of numbers in a form that they comprehend from the start so that they understand what they are doing, they will enjoy the fact that two-plus-two can be depended on to make four. They may even want to make a lifework of dealing with figures. Sensing types are sound and accurate and enjoy exactitude, so they make fine accountants, payroll administrators, navigators, and statisticians.  
當然，感知類型根本不是愚蠢的-但是有人應該在六歲之前就向他們展示數字的意義。如果從一開始就以數字的形式給他們以數字的含義，以便他們理解自己在做什麼，那麼他們將享受到一個事實，即2加2取決於4。他們甚至可能想做一些與數字打交道的工作。傳感類型準確，準確並且享受精確度，因此它們可以使會計，薪資管理人員，導航員和統計人員成為高級人員。(Google 翻譯)  

Fore sensing children to exercise their special gift of realism, they must have access to the facts and time to assimilate them. Whereas the intuitive children like to learn by insight, the sensing children prefer to lean by familiarization. They sensing types are most likely to shine in courses involving many solid facts, like history, geography, civics, or biology. They are at a corresponding disadvantage in subjects based on general principles. Often the trouble may be simply that the teacher has been too brief and abstract in referring to the principles and has passed over them so quickly that the sensing students have not had time to relate them to the facts. Physics, for example, can be a nightmare to the factually minded.  
在意識到兒童要行使他們特殊的現實主義天賦之前，他們必須能夠利用事實和時間來吸收他們。直覺的孩子喜歡通過洞察力來學習，而有感覺的孩子則喜歡通過熟悉來學習。他們的感覺類型最有可能在涉及許多紮實事實的課程中大放異彩，例如歷史，地理，公民或生物學。在基於一般原理的學科中，它們處於相應的劣勢。通常，麻煩可能僅僅是因為教師在提及這些原則時過於簡短和抽象，並且已經過分地接受這些原則，以至於感性的學生沒有時間將它們與事實聯繫起來。例如，物理學可能會成為事實思維的噩夢。(Google 翻譯)  

One case in point may be cited for its irony. An earnest and hardworking "B" student who wanted to be a doctor and was an excellent type for it, an ISFJ, flunked a pre-medical course because he could not keep up in physics with the engineers. Now he is a doctor and his patients do not care about the speed of his diagnosis, so long as it sound. The very reliance upon sensing that made physics difficult is useful now. He is dealing with immediate realities -- rhythm of a heartbeat, the sound of breathing, the shade of flush or pallor -- the myriad details a doctor must note and weigh. Touch, sight, and hearing must be his ultimate guides in applying either his own experience or the wisdom of his books. Research medicine, the medical school faculties, and the complex specialties need the intuitives; but as family doctors the sensing types come into their own, and their aptitude for physics has little if anything to do with their competence. Johns Hopkins University long ago recognized this discrepancy and instituted a special physics course for premedical students. The regular course had been disqualifying valued students.  
具有諷刺意味的就是一個例子。 ISFJ是一位認真而勤奮的B級學生，他想當一名醫生，並且是出色的職業，因此ISFJ未能完成醫學預科課程，因為他無法跟上工程師的物理學步伐。現在，他是一名醫生，他的患者們並不在乎他的診斷速度，只要聽起來就可以。現在，非常依賴於感知使物理學變得困難，這是有用的。他正在處理眼前的現實-心律律動，呼吸聲，臉紅或蒼白-醫生必須注意並稱重的無數細節。觸摸，視覺和聽覺必須是他運用自己的經驗或書本上的智慧的最終指導。研究醫學，醫學院係以及復雜的專業需要直觀的知識；但是，作為家庭醫生，感應類型就各有千秋，而且他們對物理學的天賦與他們的能力幾乎沒有關係。約翰霍普金斯大學很久以前就認識到這種差異，並為醫學預科生開設了特殊的物理課程。常規課程取消了重要學生的資格。(Google 翻譯)  

When the time comes that educators take into account the SN preference and try to meet the divergent needs of students, beginning with kindergartners, there will be a much happier and more effective use of human resources. Young realists will no longer be penalized for their reliance on direct observation and first-hand experience -- as Charles Darwin was in his boyhood, when his classical schoolmasters rated him below average in mental power.  
當教育工作者考慮到SN偏好並嘗試滿足學生的不同需求的時候到來（從幼稚園開始），將會有更快樂，更有效地利用人力資源。年輕的現實主義者將不再因其依賴直接觀察和第一手經驗而受到懲罰-就像查爾斯·達爾文（Charles Darwin）少年時代那樣，當時他的古典校長將他的心理能力評為低於平均水平。(Google 翻譯)  

A summary of the contrasting traits resulting from the SN preference is given here in parallel columns in Figure 25. These traits are most evident in the EP types, whose perceptive process is both extraverted and dominant and consequently most visible and least restrained. When the perceptive process is merely the auxiliary, it is subordinate to the judgment of the dominant process, and its mainifestations tend to be more moderate.  
SN偏好導致的對比特徵的摘要在此處的圖25的平行列中給出。這些特徵在EP類型中最為明顯，其感知過程既是外向性的又是主導性的，因此最明顯且受最少的限制。當知覺過程僅僅是輔助過程時，它服從於對主導過程的判斷，其表現形式往往更為溫和。(Google 翻譯)
