## Chapter 3 
# Type Tables for Comparison and Discovery

Since people of each type must experience the opposites in their own way, readers will naturally see the type theory and the actual consequences of the preferences from their own points of view, in the light of the preferences which they themselves hold. The discussions in the following chapters, and the statistics that readers may gather, will mean much more to them after they have seen the types for themselves.  

Therefore, people who work with the Type Indicator should observe the preferences in action and compare the descriptions with the everyday behavior of the types. Observers may notice new things and wish to amend the descriptions to fit their own opinions. The important thing is to gain a first-hand understanding of the types.  

The obvious obstacle is that there are sixteen types, which are too many to keep in mind by brute memory. Their distinguishing qualities can best be seen by comparison and contrast. The easiest way to remember what is read and observed about each type is to populate a “Type Table” with family and friends.  

The Type Table is a device for seeing all the types in relation to each other. It arranges the types so that those in specific areas of the Table have certain preferences in common and hence share whatever qualities arise from those preferences. It is therefore valuable both for analysis of research data and for systematic personal observation. Personalized with the names of friends and family, the Type Table and the type differences come to life.  

It is a great convenience in using the Type Table to know where each type is without hunting for it. The following aids to memory will help.  

Starting with perception, one of the earliest and most observable choices, the Type Table first divides for SN. All the sensing types go in the left half; all the intuitive types in the right half. It is easy to remember which half is which: in the expression “SN preference,” S is on the left and N is on the right. So the first step is:  

Sensing Types    Intuitive Types
 -S--     -N--

Next comes judgment, possibly the next most discernible choice. Dividing each half for TF produces the four combinations of perception and judgment. The two columns with feeling are side by side in the middle, and the two columns with thinking have the outermost locations. This arrangement reflects the closer relationships feeling types have with other people, whereas thinking types are more detached. The second step, therefore, is:  


Sensing Types    Intuitive Types
Thinking   |   Feeling   |   Feeling   |   Thinking
-ST-   |   -SF-   | -NF-  | -NT-    

Remember that in going from one combination to the next, only one preference changes at a time. Thus each combination has one process in common with those nearest to it.  

The next step is to divide for EI. The introvert types go in the upper or “northern” half of the Type Table, where, in the best New England tradition, they can be thought of as silent, reserved, slow to unbend, and inclined to mind their own business and leave others to do the same. The extravert types, who can be thought of as being more open, accessible, communicative, and friendly, go in the lower or “southern” half. (No geographical differences in type should be inferred from this.) So the third step is:  

  | Sensing Types |  Intuitive Types 
  | Thinking | Feeling | Feeling | Thinking 
Introvert | IST- | ISF- | INF- | INT-
Extravert | EST- | ESF- | ENF- | ENT- 

The final division, for JP, divides each horizontal row into two, and the result is the complete Type Table with four rows and four columns, as shown in Figure 2. The arrangement of the horizontal rows is designed to place at the bottom the E--Js, extraverts with the judging attitude. The E--Ps, the perceptive extraverts, come just above them. Next, changing only one preference at a time, come the I--P types, the perceptive introverts. The top row is occupied by the I--J types, the judging introverts, balancing the judging extraverts at the bottom. Thus, the more resistant types, the thinkers at left and right and the judging types at top and bottom, make a sort of wall around the Type Table; the “gentler” FP types are inside. The types with both of the resistant preferences, the tough-minded, executive TJs, occupy the four corners.

**Figure 2 The Type Table**   
  
  
With these devices in mind --SN going from left to right, the feeling columns affiliating with each other in the center, the “northern” introverts and “southern” extraverts, and the judging types taking the brunt at the top and bottom -- the Type Table can be remembered and reproduced from memory. More important, the Type Table makes a logical framework within which to store the characteristics of the types.  

A full-size Type Table is printed at the end of this book (see pages 208 and 209). For each of the types, there is enough space for readers to list names and, if desired, occupations of friends, family, co-workers, and so on, who fit the different types. Once the Table is well-populated, the differences between extraverts and introverts can be clarified by contrasting the people in the lower half with those in the upper half. The SN preference will be illustrated by the contrast between the left and right halves, the TF preference by the contrast between the outermost and middle columns, and the JP preference by the way the people in the top and bottom rows differ from those in the middle rows.  

With the effects of the separate preferences thus established, various areas of the Type Table take on a definite character from the interaction of the preferences. It seems natural that many psychiatrists are found in the intuition-plus-feeling column. It is clear why would-be young executives are often TJ. It is reasonable that students at the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce are most often ES and those at Cal Tech are most often IN.  

Conversely, when a sample defined by occupation, college major, years of education, or any propensity are distributed in a Type Table, a concentration in an area of the Table may point out new facts about the type in that area.  

For identifying types and groups of types, letters are more precise and convenient than words. A group of types with one or more preferences in common can be defined precisely by the common letter(s), arranged in standard order, with dashes where the letters are not adjacent.  

In this book, a type designation is to be taken in its broadest sense. The eight types in the left half of the Type Table are therefore all sensing types, and the eight types in the right half are all intuitives.    

On the other hand, the qualified term introverted intuitive always means an introvert in whom intuition is dominant, an IN-J type; the term extraverted intuitive always means an extravert in whom intuition dominates, an EN-P. Similarly, introverted sensing type referes to an IS-J and extraverted sensing type means an ES-P, and so on. These are the formal names of Jung’s original eight types.  

The preposition with, as used throughout this book, denotes the combination of two preferences without reference to dominance. The four IN types in the upper right quarter of the Type Table are “introverts with intuition”; the types in the NF column are “intuitives with feeling”; and so on.  

The Type Tables in Figures 3-23 show the meanings of the letter combinations and, more important, illustrate the use of frequencies in making discoveries about the individual types. If a particular type is much more (or much less) frequent in a given sample than expected, the characteristics of the type may be responsible for this distribution.  

In exploring such hypotheses, it is necessary to adopt a reasonable estimate of the frequency to be expected for those types. Most of the Type Tables in this chapter adopt for this purpose the frequencies actually found in a sample of 3,503 high school males preparing for college, as shown in the Type Table in Figure 3. The samples in Figures 5 and 8 were combined to make this group, which was also used for the expected frequencies on page 45 of the 1962 Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Manual.

The Type Tables in Figures 3-23 show the heaviest frequencies and the areas with relatively sparse populations. In these Figures, the percent of the sample belonging to each type is written and shown graphically either with black squares, each representing roughly 2 percent, or with black circles, each standing for approximately 2 persons.  (Circles are used in Figures 16, 17, 18, and 20, in which the samples are less than 100.) The total number of extraverts, introverts, and so on and the percentage each number represents are given below the Tables.  

**(Plz get figure 4 from original book)**    
**Figure 4 High School Students, Other Than College Prep (N=1,430 males)**  

The Type Tables in Figures 4 and 5 show male high school students, mainly eleventh-and twelfth-graders, who took Form D2 of the Indicator in 25 high schools in the suburban counties around Philadelphia in the spring of 1957, a period when sharp distinctions were maintained between college preparatory and nonpreparatory high school programs.

**Figure 5 High School Students, College Prep (N = 2,603 males)**   
  
On preferences other than SN, the differences in frequency are minimal. In both Tables the most frequent type is an S type, ESTJ, and the least frequent is an N type, INFJ. Otherwise these samples reveal fairly equal distributions, which is appropriate enough, since high school students are a heterogeneous group of very different people who will eventually ride off in all directions. College Type Tables (Figures 12-19) show some of those directions.   
  
**(Plz get figure 6 from original book)**    
**Figure 6 High School Students, Other Than College Prep (N = 1,884 females)**    
  
The corresponding Type Tables for females, Figures 6 and 7, confirm the relation between intuition and educational level; they also demonstrate the magnitude of the sex difference on TF. Both females samples are 68 percent feeling; the nonpreparatory males are 41 percent feeling, the college preparatory males 38 percent. Because of this sex difference, data involving type frequencies for males and females must be presented separately; if pooled, the frequencies misrepresent both sexes.  
  
**(Plz get figure 7 from original book)**     
**Figure 7 High School Students, College Prep (N = 2,155 females)**    

The sensing types in Fugures 6 and 7 show a strong preference for the judging attitude. The nonpreparatory sample, which has very few intuitives, is 65 percent J. Sensing types prefer, on the whole, to run their outer lives in a judging way that settles problem in advance. Intuitives like to run their in a perceptive way that lets their intuition follow its inspirations.  

**(Plz get figure 8 from original book)**     
**Figure 8 Central High School Students, (N = 900 males)**    

The Type Table in Figure 8 shows high school males preparing for college -- but these studetns were preparing at the all-male Central High School in Philadelphia, to which no student is admitted unless he has an IQ of 110 or higher and no more than one grade as low as C in the two years before enrolling.  
  
It might be thought that the second requirement, which involves not seriously slighting any subject, would result in a substantial increase in the number of J students. The number of J students did go up, but only from 50.4 percent to 53.3 percent.  

**(Plz get figure 9 from original book)**     
**Figure 9 Nation Merit Finalists (N = 671 males)**  
The frequency of N went up from 38 percent to 54 percent, which resulted in a symmertical lowering of the frequencies of the four SP types, who have neither N nor J.  
  
For the National Merit finalists, Figure 9, the frequency of N went up from 54 percent to 82.7 percent. Of the remaining 17.3 percent who were S, the outstanding survivor was ISTJ, holding 5 percent of the sample.    

**(Plz get figure 10 from original book)**     
**Figure 10 Philadelphia Girls' Hight School Student (N = 348 females)**  

The corresponding selective high school for females is Philadelphia Girls's High School, which has the same requirements for admission as Central. Frequency distributions in the Type Tables in Figures 10 and 11 are much like those for the corresponding male samples, except that the males have a majority for T, whereas the females have a majority for F, as has been seen before.  

Introverts at Girl's High  are 38.2 percent, rising to 52.1 percent among the National Merit finalists.  

Intuitives at Girls' High are 50 percent, rising to 81.8 percent in the National Merit sample.  

**(Plz get figure 11 from original book)**     
**Figure 11 National Merit Finalists (N = 330 females)**  

As with ISTJ for the males, the outstanding survivor of the S types among the female National Merit finalists was ISFJ, with a 5 percent frequency matching that of the males.  

Here self-selection begins. After high school, students can choose whatever line of study they like. The degree of self-selection exercised by any type in any sample can be indicated by the self-0selection ratio (SSR), which is the percentage frequency of that type in the sample divided by its percentage frequency in the appropriate base population. For the samples in this chapter, except for the arts and counseling students, the base population is 3,503 high school males (Figure 3).  

**(Plz get figure 12 from original book)**     
**Figure 12 Liberal Arts Students (N = 3,676 males)**  

In Figures 12-23, the SSR is shown for each of the sixteen types, Values above 1.00 show positive self-selection. Values below 1.00 show some degree of avoidance. Where types with the highest SSR (often 1.20 or higher) are adjacent, they make a self-selection area and are shaded in the Type Table.  

For the males in liberal arts, shown in Figure 12, the self-selection area consists of the four NF types, typically interested in literature and humanities, and the two INT types, mildly interested in liberal arts but more interested in other fields.  

**(Plz get figure 13 from original book)**     
**Figure 13 Engineering Students (N = 2,188)**  

For the engineering students, shown in Figure 13, the self-selection area consists of the IN quadrant, the two ENJ types, and ISTJ. The emphasis is on N and J, and F when combined with NJ seems nearly as attracted to engineering as T.  Note that the ENJ types would be adjacent to the IN quadrant if wrapped around a horixzontal cylinder,  and so would ISTJ if wrapped around a vertical one.  

(These are the liberal arts and engineering samples from page 45 of the 1962 MBTI Manual.)

**Figure 14 Finance and Commerce Students (N = 488)**  

The Type Table in Figure 14 shows 488 undergraduates from the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania. The Type Table opposite, in Figure 15, is really opposite, showing 705 science majors from Cal Tech.  

The self-selection area for the finance and commerce students consists of the ES quadrant plus the two IST types, which is wholly suitable. The ST column is the one where the main objects of interest are the facts, approached with impersonal analysis, in a hardheaded, matterr-of-fact way. The ES quadrant is the most practical and realistic quadrant and the least given to intellectual abstractions.  

**(Plz get figure 15 from original book)**     
**Figure 15 Science Students (N = 705)**  

The self-selection area for the Cal Tech science students consists of the IN quadrant (in which the highest SSR is 3.88 and the lowest one 1.97) plus the two ENT types. People in the NT column focus on the possibilities and the principles involved in their solution. Inhabitants of the IN quadrant are the most intellectual, with a capacity for seeing farther into the unknown than most people can penetrate. The degree of interest that the science students have for the ES quadrant can be judged by the self-selection ratios they award it: 0.22, 0.17, 0.12, and 0.02.

The Type Tables in Figures 16-18, based on Stephens (1972), present three contrasting groups of senior art students at the University of Florida. The base population against which their self-selection is measured is a freshman class at the same university at about the same period.  

The sample in Figure 16 consists of fine arts seniors who were planning to be artists, to create without reference to others. The four types showing positive self-selectiojn are all IN types -- intuition for creativity and introversion for independence from the outer world.  


**(Plz get figure 17 from original book)**     
**Figure 17 Occupational Therapy Seniors (N = 29)**  
Source: Stephens (1972)  

The seniors in Figure 17 were studying occupational theraphy and planning to use art for restoring people to health, whether by giving them a new interest in life of new confident in themselves or simply and enjoyable manual activity. All five of the types showing positive self-selection are extravert types, to whom overt action is important, and four of those five types are F types, to whom it is important that the action involve other people in a beneficial way. The type with the strongest self-selection is ESFJ, where feeling is extraverted and perception is practical, so that helping others is both a duty and a pleasure.

**Figure 18 Art Education Seniors (N = 31)**  
Source: Stephens (1972)  

In examining Figure 18, which reports on art education seniors, one finds a wide diversity of types who have chosen that filed, perhaps because the field itself is diverse. This sample has six types with positive self-selection, three in common with fine arts students, three in common with occupational therapy students; three are I, three are E; three are NF, two are NT, and one is the somewhat detached SF. Probably the teaching styles these people developed would be found to vary accordingly.  

**(Plz get figure 19 from original book)**     
**Figure 19 Counselor Education Students (N = 118)**  

In Figure 19, counselor education, self-selection seems confined to the NF types. Each NF type has a self-selection ratio of 1.80 or higher, and no other type has a self-selection ratio higher than 0.62. The reason is easily understood: The combination of intuition and feeling practically defines counseling. The province of intuition is too see the possibilities, and the province of feeling is a concern for people, which makes the exercise of intuition doubly rewarding, since it is possibilities for people that are sought and found.  

The subjects in this sample were students at the University of Florida who gave their major as counseling education. For their SSRs  also, the base population was the Florida freshman.  

**(Plz get figure 20 from original book)**     
**Figure 20 Rhodes Scholars (N = 71 males)**  

The sample of Rhodes Scholars, shown in Fugure 20, is the result of stringent competition. It has an even higher percentage of intuitives than the National Merit finalists. The majority are feeling types, probably because in defining the scholar Rhodes desired, his will stressed kindness and interest in others.  

Figure 21 is based on data from Miller's follow-up study (1967) of students from seven law schools, including the dropouts. The number of dropouts from  each type is shown, preceded by a minus sign, on the same line as the frequency for that type. The dropout ratio (DOR), which is the type's percentage dropout divided by the percentage dropout for the sample as a whole, is given below the SSR.
