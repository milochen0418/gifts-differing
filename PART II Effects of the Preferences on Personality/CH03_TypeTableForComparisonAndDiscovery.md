## Chapter 3 
# Type Tables for Comparison and Discovery

Since people of each type must experience the opposites in their own way, readers will naturally see the type theory and the actual consequences of the preferences from their own points of view, in the light of the preferences which they themselves hold. The discussions in the following chapters, and the statistics that readers may gather, will mean much more to them after they have seen the types for themselves.  

Therefore, people who work with the Type Indicator should observe the preferences in action and compare the descriptions with the everyday behavior of the types. Observers may notice new things and wish to amend the descriptions to fit their own opinions. The important thing is to gain a first-hand understanding of the types.  

The obvious obstacle is that there are sixteen types, which are too many to keep in mind by brute memory. Their distinguishing qualities can best be seen by comparison and contrast. The easiest way to remember what is read and observed about each type is to populate a “Type Table” with family and friends.  

The Type Table is a device for seeing all the types in relation to each other. It arranges the types so that those in specific areas of the Table have certain preferences in common and hence share whatever qualities arise from those preferences. It is therefore valuable both for analysis of research data and for systematic personal observation. Personalized with the names of friends and family, the Type Table and the type differences come to life.  

It is a great convenience in using the Type Table to know where each type is without hunting for it. The following aids to memory will help.  

Starting with perception, one of the earliest and most observable choices, the Type Table first divides for SN. All the sensing types go in the left half; all the intuitive types in the right half. It is easy to remember which half is which: in the expression “SN preference,” S is on the left and N is on the right. So the first step is:  

Sensing Types    Intuitive Types
 -S--     -N--

Next comes judgment, possibly the next most discernible choice. Dividing each half for TF produces the four combinations of perception and judgment. The two columns with feeling are side by side in the middle, and the two columns with thinking have the outermost locations. This arrangement reflects the closer relationships feeling types have with other people, whereas thinking types are more detached. The second step, therefore, is:  


Sensing Types    Intuitive Types
Thinking   |   Feeling   |   Feeling   |   Thinking
-ST-   |   -SF-   | -NF-  | -NT-    

Remember that in going from one combination to the next, only one preference changes at a time. Thus each combination has one process in common with those nearest to it.  

The next step is to divide for EI. The introvert types go in the upper or “northern” half of the Type Table, where, in the best New England tradition, they can be thought of as silent, reserved, slow to unbend, and inclined to mind their own business and leave others to do the same. The extravert types, who can be thought of as being more open, accessible, communicative, and friendly, go in the lower or “southern” half. (No geographical differences in type should be inferred from this.) So the third step is:  

  | Sensing Types |  Intuitive Types 
  | Thinking | Feeling | Feeling | Thinking 
Introvert | IST- | ISF- | INF- | INT-
Extravert | EST- | ESF- | ENF- | ENT- 

The final division, for JP, divides each horizontal row into two, and the result is the complete Type Table with four rows and four columns, as shown in Figure 2. The arrangement of the horizontal rows is designed to place at the bottom the E--Js, extraverts with the judging attitude. The E--Ps, the perceptive extraverts, come just above them. Next, changing only one preference at a time, come the I--P types, the perceptive introverts. The top row is occupied by the I--J types, the judging introverts, balancing the judging extraverts at the bottom. Thus, the more resistant types, the thinkers at left and right and the judging types at top and bottom, make a sort of wall around the Type Table; the “gentler” FP types are inside. The types with both of the resistant preferences, the tough-minded, executive TJs, occupy the four corners.

With these devices in mind --SN going from left to right, the feeling columns affiliating with each other in the center, the “northern” introverts and “southern” extraverts, and the judging types taking the brunt at the top and bottom -- the Type Table can be remembered and reproduced from memory. More important, the Type Table makes a logical framework within which to store the characteristics of the types.  

A full-size Type Table is printed at the end of this book (see pages 208 and 209). For each of the types, there is enough space for readers to list names and, if desired, occupations of friends, family, co-workers, and so on, who fit the different types. Once the Table is well-populated, the differences between extraverts and introverts can be clarified by contrasting the people in the lower half with those in the upper half. The SN preference will be illustrated by the contrast between the left and right halves, the TF preference by the contrast between the outermost and middle columns, and the JP preference by the way the people in the top and bottom rows differ from those in the middle rows.  

With the effects of the separate preferences thus established, various areas of the Type Table take on a definite character from the interaction of the preferences. It seems natural that many psychiatrists are found in the intuition-plus-feeling column. It is clear why would-be young executives are often TJ. It is reasonable that students at the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce are most often ES and those at Cal Tech are most often IN.  

Conversely, when a sample defined by occupation, college major, years of education, or any propensity are distributed in a Type Table, a concentration in an area of the Table may point out new facts about the type in that area.  

For identifying types and groups of types, letters are more precise and convenient than words. A group of types with one or more preferences in common can be defined precisely by the common letter(s), arranged in standard order, with dashes where the letters are not adjacent.  

In this book, a type designation is to be taken in its broadest sense. The eight types in the left half of the Type Table are therefore all sensing types, and the eight types in the right half are all intuitives.    

On the other hand, the qualified term introverted intuitive always means an introvert in whom intuition is dominant, an IN-J type; the term extraverted intuitive always means an extravert in whom intuition dominates, an EN-P. Similarly, introverted sensing type referes to an IS-J and extraverted sensing type means an ES-P, and so on. These are the formal names of Jung’s original eight types.  

The preposition with, as used throughout this book, denotes the combination of two preferences without reference to dominance. The four IN types in the upper right quarter of the Type Table are “introverts with intuition”; the types in the NF column are “intuitives with feeling”; and so on.  

The Type Tables in Figures 3-23 show the meanings of the letter combinations and, more important, illustrate the use of frequencies in making discoveries about the individual types. If a particular type is much more (or much less) frequent in a given sample than expected, the characteristics of the type may be responsible for this distribution.  

In exploring such hypotheses, it is necessary to adopt a reasonable estimate of the frequency to be expected for those types. Most of the Type Tables in this chapter adopt for this purpose the frequencies actually found in a sample of 3,503 high school males preparing for college, as shown in the Type Table in Figure 3. The samples in Figures 5 and 8 were combined to make this group, which was also used for the expected frequencies on page 45 of the 1962 Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Manual.

The Type Tables in Figures 3-23 show the heaviest frequencies and the areas with relatively sparse populations. In these Figures, the percent of the sample belonging to each type is written and shown graphically either with black squares, each representing roughly 2 percent, or with black circles, each standing for approximately 2 persons.  (Circles are used in Figures 16, 17, 18, and 20, in which the samples are less than 100.) The total number of extraverts, introverts, and so on and the percentage each number represents are given below the Tables.

The Type Tables in Figures 4 and 5 show male high school students, mainly eleventh-and twelfth-graders, who took Form D2 of the Indicator in 25 high schools in the suburban counties around Philadelphia in the spring of 1957, a period when sharp distinctions were maintained between college preparatory and nonpreparatory high school programs.
