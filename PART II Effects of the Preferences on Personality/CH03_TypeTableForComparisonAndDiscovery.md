## Chapter 3 
# Type Tables for Comparison and Discovery

Since people of each type must experience the opposites in their own way, readers will naturally see the type theory and the actual consequences of the preferences from their own points of view, in the light of the preferences which they themselves hold. The discussions in the following chapters, and the statistics that readers may gather, will mean much more to them after they have seen the types for themselves.  

Therefore, people who work with the Type Indicator should observe the preferences in action and compare the descriptions with the everyday behavior of the types. Observers may notice new things and wish to amend the descriptions to fit their own opinions. The important thing is to gain a first-hand understanding of the types.  

The obvious obstacle is that there are sixteen types, which are too many to keep in mind by brute memory. Their distinguishing qualities can best be seen by comparison and contrast. The easiest way to remember what is read and observed about each type is to populate a “Type Table” with family and friends.  

The Type Table is a device for seeing all the types in relation to each other. It arranges the types so that those in specific areas of the Table have certain preferences in common and hence share whatever qualities arise from those preferences. It is therefore valuable both for analysis of research data and for systematic personal observation. Personalized with the names of friends and family, the Type Table and the type differences come to life.  

It is a great convenience in using the Type Table to know where each type is without hunting for it. The following aids to memory will help.  

Starting with perception, one of the earliest and most observable choices, the Type Table first divides for SN. All the sensing types go in the left half; all the intuitive types in the right half. It is easy to remember which half is which: in the expression “SN preference,” S is on the left and N is on the right. So the first step is:  

Sensing Types    Intuitive Types
 -S--     -N--

Next comes judgment, possibly the next most discernible choice. Dividing each half for TF produces the four combinations of perception and judgment. The two columns with feeling are side by side in the middle, and the two columns with thinking have the outermost locations. This arrangement reflects the closer relationships feeling types have with other people, whereas thinking types are more detached. The second step, therefore, is:  


Sensing Types    Intuitive Types
Thinking   |   Feeling   |   Feeling   |   Thinking
-ST-   |   -SF-   | -NF-  | -NT-    

Remember that in going from one combination to the next, only one preference changes at a time. Thus each combination has one process in common with those nearest to it.  

The next step is to divide for EI. The introvert types go in the upper or “northern” half of the Type Table, where, in the best New England tradition, they can be thought of as silent, reserved, slow to unbend, and inclined to mind their own business and leave others to do the same. The extravert types, who can be thought of as being more open, accessible, communicative, and friendly, go in the lower or “southern” half. (No geographical differences in type should be inferred from this.) So the third step is:  

  | Sensing Types |  Intuitive Types 
  | Thinking | Feeling | Feeling | Thinking 
Introvert | IST- | ISF- | INF- | INT-
Extravert | EST- | ESF- | ENF- | ENT- 

The final division, for JP, divides each horizontal row into two, and the result is the complete Type Table with four rows and four columns, as shown in Figure 2. The arrangement of the horizontal rows is designed to place at the bottom the E--Js, extraverts with the judging attitude. The E--Ps, the perceptive extraverts, come just above them. Next, changing only one preference at a time, come the I--P types, the perceptive introverts. The top row is occupied by the I--J types, the judging introverts, balancing the judging extraverts at the bottom. Thus, the more resistant types, the thinkers at left and right and the judging types at top and bottom, make a sort of wall around the Type Table; the “gentler” FP types are inside. The types with both of the resistant preferences, the tough-minded, executive TJs, occupy the four corners.
