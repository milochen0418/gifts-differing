## Chapter 4 
# Effect of the EI Preference 

The conduct of extraverts is based on the outer situation. If they are thinkers, they tend to criticize or analyze or organize it; feeling types may champion it, protest against it, or try to mitigate it; sensing types may enjoy it, use it, or good naturedly put up with it; and intuitives tend to try to change it. In any case, the extravert starts with the outer situation.  
外向的行為是基於外部情況。如果他們是思想家，他們傾向於批評，分析或組織它。感覺類型可能會支持它，抗議它或試圖減輕它；感覺型的人可能會喜歡它，使用它或天生就忍受它；和直觀人士傾向於嘗試對其進行更改。無論如何，外向都是從外部情況開始的。(Google翻譯)  

The introvert, however, starts farther back -- with the inner ideas, the mental concepts, derived from what Jung calls the archetypes. Type theory holds that the archetypes are inborn in us all. They do not have their origin in our own experience, though personal experience may activate them. They are the abstract essence of the experience and aspiration of humanity. They are the universals, the shapes of thought, which bring pattern and meaning out of the overwhelming multiplicity of life. (Extraverts find multiplicity rather jolly; but it can be intolerably distracting to introverts unless they can see a unifying meaning that brings it under control.)  
然而，內向的人要追溯到更遠的地方-內心的想法，心理概念是由榮格所稱的原型衍生而來的。類型理論認為原型是我們天生的。儘管我們的個人經歷可能會激發他們的生命，但它們並非源自我們自己的經驗。它們是人類經驗和追求的抽象本質。它們是普遍性，思想形態，它們將模式和意義帶離了壓倒性的生活多樣性。 （性格外向的人發現多元性​​很快樂；但是，內向型人會難以忍受地分散他們的注意力，除非他們看到將其控制的統一含義。）(Google翻譯)    

When an outer situation encountered by introverts corresponds to a familiar idea or concept, they meet the situation with a sense of recognition, as though seeing a good illustration of something long known. For such situations the introverts have a profound understanding. If, however, the outer situation does not correspond at all to familiar concepts, it may seem accidental, irrelevant, and unimportant, and the introverts are very likely to mishandle it. One historic example is Woodrow Wilson's blindness at Versailles, when he stacked the peace upon the League of Nations, a decision that his own country was not ready to accept. He was too wrapped up in the idea of world organization to give the idea of democratic process its due -- so the Senate seemed irrelevant to him, and he failed.  
當性格內向的人遇到的外部情況對應於一個熟悉的想法或概念時，他們以一種認可的感覺滿足這種情況，好像看到了一個眾所周知的事物的良好例證。對於這種情況，性格內向的人有深刻的理解。但是，如果外部情況根本不符合熟悉的概念，則這似乎是偶然的，無關緊要的和不重要的，並且內向的人很可能會錯誤地處理它。一個歷史性的例子是伍德羅·威爾遜（Woodrow Wilson）對凡爾賽的盲目性，當時他將和平放在國際聯盟上，這一決定使他自己的國家不願接受。他過於沉迷於世界組織的思想，以至於不能給予民主進程這一思想-所以參議院似乎與他無關，而他失敗了。(Google翻譯)    

Because introverts' energies are powerfully directed by their ideas, it is supremely important for introverts to have the "right idea" about things. Their characteristic pause before action, which extraverts carelessly call hesitation, serves a real purpose. It gives time to study and classify a new situation so the action taken will make sense in the long run. Problems arise for the introverts because they often do not look closely enough at the outer situation and, therefore, do not really see it. The extraverts often do not stop looking at the specific situation long enough to see the underlying idea.  
因為性格內向的人的能量強烈地受到他們思想的支配，所以對性格內向的人對事物有“正確的想法”至關重要。他們特有的行動前停頓，這毫不留情地被稱為猶豫，是真正的目的。它給了研究和分類新情況的時間，因此從長遠來看，採取的措施將是有意義的。內向的人會出現問題，因為內向的人通常對外部情況的關注不夠，因此看不到它。外向型人經常不停地註視著特定的情況，以至於看不到根本的想法。(Google翻譯)    

The advantages of starting with the outer situation are obvious and much esteemed in the present Western civilization, which is dominated by the extravert viewpoint. There are plenty of reasons for this domination: Extraverts are more vocal than introverts; they are more numerous, apparently in the ratio of three to one; and they are accessible and understandable, whereas the introverts are not readily understandable, even to each other, and are likely to be thoroughly incomprehensible to the extraverts.  
從外部局勢出發的優勢是顯而易見的，並且在當今的西方文明中備受推崇，而西方文明則以外向的觀點為主導。這種統治的原因有很多：外向的人比內向的人更發聲；他們更多，顯然是三比一；它們是可訪問且可理解的，而性格內向的人甚至彼此之間都不容易理解，外向型人可能完全無法理解。(Google翻譯)    

Consequently, the introverts' advantages need to be pointed out -- not only to the extraverts but sometimes even to the introverts themselves -- for the best-adjusted people are the "psychologically patriotic," who are glad to be what they are. The ablest introverts achieve a fine facility at extraversion, but never try to be extraverts. Through good development of an auxiliary process, they have learned to deal competently with the outer world without pledging any allegiance to it. Their loyalty goes to their own inner principle and derives from it a secure and unshakable orientation to life.  
因此，需要指出內向的人的優勢-不僅對內向的人，有時甚至對內向的人也要指出的-因為適應能力最好的人是“心理上的愛國主義者”，他們很樂意成為自己。最能幹的性格內向的人在性格外向時會表現出很好的能力，但從不嘗試成為性格外向的人。通過輔助程序的良好發展，他們學會了在不效忠於外部世界的情況下與外部世界打交道。他們忠於自己的內在原則，並從中得出對生活安全且堅定不移的態度。(Google翻譯)  

One advantage of the introverts is their inherent continuity, and independence of the momentary outward situation, which often is as accidental as it seems to them. Outer conditions and stimuli continually vary, but inner stimuli are far more constant. Introvert children, entirely ignoring many of the distracting outer stimuli, follow their own quiet bent, and parents of restless little extraverts marvel at the introverts' "powers of concentration."  
內向的人的優勢之一是他們固有的連續性，以及暫時外向情況的獨立性，這在他們看來常常是偶然的。外部條件和刺激不斷變化，但內部刺激則更加恆定。內向的孩子完全忽略了許多分散注意力的外部刺激，跟隨著自己安靜的彎腰，躁動不安的小外向者的父母對內向者的“專注力”感到驚訝。(Google翻譯)  

This faculty of concentration is likely to characterize the introverts' careers. Whereas extraverts tend to broaden the sphere of their work, to present their products early (and often) to the world, to make themselves known to a wide circle, and to multiply relationships and activities, the introvert takes the opposite approach. Going more deeply into their work, introverts are reluctant to call it finished and publish it, and when they do, they tend to give only their conclusions, without the details of what they did. This impersonal brevity of communication narrows their audience and fame, but saves them from overwhelming external demands and allows them to return to another uninterrupted stretch of work. As Jung is reported to have said, the introverts' activity thereby gains in depth and their labor has lasting value.   
這個專心的教師很可能是性格內向的人的職業。外向型人傾向於拓寬他們的工作範圍，儘早（經常）向世界展示他們的產品，使其廣為人知，並擴大關係和活動，而內向型人則採取相反的方法。內向的人更深入地研究他們的工作，不願稱其為完成並出版，而當他們這樣做時，他們傾向於僅給出結論，而沒有所做工作的細節。這種非個人化的交流方式使他們的聽眾和名聲縮窄了，但使他們免於壓倒性的外部需求，使他們可以重返另一段不間斷的工作領域。正如榮格所說的那樣，內向的人的活動因此而深入，其工作具有持久的價值。(Google翻譯)  

Another useful aspect of the detachment characteristic of introverts is that they are little affected by the absence of encouragement. If they believe in what they are doing, they can work happily for a long time without reassurance, as pioneers usually must. Such behavior does not make sense to most extraverts. One brilliant and very extraverted young woman (an ENTP) protested, "But I'm never sure whether my work is good or not until I know what other people think of it!"   
內向型人的分離特性的另一個有用方面是，內向型人很少受到鼓勵的影響。如果他們相信自己的所作所為，那麼他們就可以像開拓者通常那樣放心地長時間工作而不放心。這種行為對大多數外向者沒有意義。一位才華橫溢，性格外向的年輕女子（ENTP）抗議道：“但是我不知道自己的工作是否好，直到我知道其他人的想法！”(Google翻譯)  

Finally, although extraverts certainly have more worldly wisdom and a better sense of expediency, introverts have a corresponding advantage in unworldly wisdom. They are closer to the eternal truths. The contrast is especially apparent when an extravert and an introvert are brought up side by side in the same family. The introvert child is often able to grasp and accept a moral principle -- "yours and mine," for example -- in its abstract form. The extravert child is usually unimpressed by the abstract principle, and usually must experience it; then, having learned the hard way what others think, the extravert has a basis for conduct.  
最後，儘管性格外向的人當然擁有更多的世俗智慧和更好的權宜之計，但性格內向的人在不世俗的智慧中具有相應的優勢。他們更接近永恆的真理。當一個內向性和內向性在同一個家庭中並排出現時，這種對比尤其明顯。性格內向的孩子通常能夠以抽象的形式掌握並接受道德原則，例如“你和我的”。外向型孩子通常對抽象原理沒有印象，通常必須經歷它。然後，在學會了別人的思維方式之後，外向者便有了行為的基礎。(Google翻譯)  

The contrasting traits resulting from the EI preference are summarized here in parallel columns in Figure 24. In general, these differences distinguish people in the lower half of the Type Table from those in the upper half.
