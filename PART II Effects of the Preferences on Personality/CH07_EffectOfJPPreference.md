# Effect of the JP Preference 判斷與感知偏好的效應區別

THE JUDGING TYPES believe that life should bewilled and decided, while the perceptive types regard life as something to be experienced and understood. Thus, judging types like to settle things, or at least to have things settled, whereas perceptive types prefer to keep their plans and opinions as open as possible so that no valulable experience or enlightement will be missed. The constrast in their lives is quite evident.  
審判類型認為生活應該是願意和決定的，而感知類型則認為生活是要經歷和理解的東西。因此，判斷型喜歡解決問題，或者至少要使事情解決，而感知型則傾向於保持計劃和觀點盡可能開放，這樣就不會錯過寶貴的經驗或啟發。他們生活中的矛盾是顯而易見的。

Judgement is eternally comming to conclusions--with the finality the word implies. Judgment really *likes* to dispose of things, even without the spur of necessity. Frequently judging types settle not only what they are to do themselves, but what others are to do. Given a little provocation, they settle what others are to think. The person who says "What you ought to do ..." ten minutes after meeting someone new is a marked judging type.  
判斷是永恆得出的結論-這個詞所暗示的終結性。判決確實*喜歡*處置事物，即使沒有必要的刺激。經常判斷類型的人不僅會解決自己要做的事情，還會解決別人要做的事情。稍加挑釁，他們就解決了別人的想法。與新朋友見面十分鐘後說“你應該怎麼做……”的人是明顯的評判類型。

Less-marked judging types think to themselves what someone else ought to do, but suppress the impulse to speak out. Perceptive types do not even think it. They would rather hear about what a person is doing. Two immortal examples of perception are Kipling's Rikki-tikki-tavi, whose motto was "run and find out," and the insatiably curious Elephant's Child who went around getting spanked for asking "why?"  
標記較少的評判類型會自己考慮別人應該做什麼，但會壓制說話的衝動。感知型甚至都不認為。他們寧願聽到一個人在做什麼。感知的兩個不朽的例子是吉卜林（Kipling）的座右銘是“奔跑並找出來”的Rikki-tikki-tavi，以及好奇心極強的“象兒”（Elephant's Child），他四處打招呼問“為什麼？”。

Such inexhaustible interest in "what?" and "why?" does not conduce to finality. The perceptive types do not come to conslusions until they must--and sometimes not even then. Being cognizant of how many factors are involved and how much is still unknown, they are rather horrified at the eagerness of the judging types to decide a matter. The saying that "a bad decision is better than none" makes sense only to a judging typej. Perceptive types always hope that they can solve the problem simply by understanding it better, by "seeing to the bottom of it" if they are intuitives or by "seeing it from all sides" if they are sensing types. Often they can. In such cases they are hardly conscious of judgment; the solution has been latent there in the situation and they have eventually "seen" what was the thing to do.  
對“什麼”有如此取之不盡的興趣。和“為什麼？”不利於確定性。感知類型只有在必須的時候才被應用，有時甚至沒有。意識到涉及多少因素，還有多少未知數，他們對判斷類型急於決定事情的渴望感到震驚。所謂“一個壞決定總比沒有好”的說法僅對判斷類型j有意義。感知型的人總是希望他們可以通過更好地理解問題來解決問題，如果他們是直覺的，則是“從根本上看”；如果是感知型的，則是“從各個方面看”。他們經常可以。在這種情況下，他們幾乎不覺察覺。解決方案在那裡一直處於潛在狀態，他們最終“看到”了該做什麼。

Of course, the perceptive types still need judgment. Their perception should be *supported* by an adequately developed judging process. Otherwise, they will drift downwind like a sailboat with its centerboard up. *It takes judgment* (either thinking or feeling will do) *to give continuity of purpose and supply a standard by which to criticize and govern one's own actions.*  
當然，感知類型仍然需要判斷。他們的看法應得到適當發展的評審程序的“支持”。否則，它們將像風帆一樣順著中心板朝上飄落。 *需要判斷*（思考或感覺都可以）*提供目的的連續性並提供批評和支配自己行為的標準。*


At the other extreme, judging types with insufficient perception have no "give" or cooperation in them. If they lack an adequately developed perceptive process, they will be narrow, rigid, and incapable of seeing any point of view except their own. This characteristic of the relentlessly judging individual is recognized in the word *prejudice*--a prejudgment impervious to perception.  
在另一個極端，判斷力不足的判斷類型在他們之間沒有“給予”或合作。如果他們缺乏充分發展的知覺過程，他們將變得狹窄，僵化，除了自己的觀點之外，看不見任何觀點。 “偏見”（prejudice）一詞可以識別個人的這種無情判斷，這是一種不可感知的偏見。
此外，如果思維或感覺類型缺乏對自己的看法，他們將不得不依靠默認內容的判斷形式。他們將接受當前環境中的形式：思想家將取決於公式和公認的原則；感覺類型將採用贊成和反對的態度。但是他們將機械地應用這些方法，而沒有對特定情況的真正了解。 *需要感知*（無論是感知還是直覺都可以）*提供理解，開放的思想和第一手的生活知識，這是保持判斷力不致盲目所需的。*

Furthermore, if thinking or feeling types lack preceptions of their own, they will be obliged to rely on the forms of judgment in default of content. They will accept the forms current in their environment: Thinkers will depend on the formulas and accepted principals; feeling types will adopt the attitudes of approval and disapproval. But they will apply these mechanically, with no genuine insight into the particular situation. *It takes perception* (either sensing or intuition will do) *to supply understanding, open-mindedness, and the first-hand knowledge of life needed to keep judgment itself from being blind.*

Thus well-balanced individuals must always have perception to support their judgment, and judgment to support their perception. Tjhey will still retain their basic preference and the qualities it gives. The gifts of judgment include:    
因此，均衡的個人必須始終具有支持自己的判斷力的感知力和支持自己的感知力的判斷力。 Tjhey仍將保留其基本偏愛及其提供的品質。 判斷力包括：

- *System in doing things.* It is natural for a judging type to decide what is the best way of doing a thing and then consistently do it that way. The thinking process tries for the most logical method; the feeling process for hte most pleasing, suitable, or proper method.  
*做事中的系統。*對於判斷類型來說，確定什麼是做某事的最佳方法，然後始終如一地做是很自然的。 思維過程會嘗試最合乎邏輯的方法； 最令人愉悅，最合適或最合適的方法的感覺過程。

- *Order in possessions.* It is a judging sentiment that order is Heaven's first law. Thinking types believe in orderliness for utiliarian reasons. TJ types may have eerything inside their bureau drawers neatly classified in boxes but not concern themselves with the state of the bureau top; FJ types, more esthetically inclined, are almost certain to have the top neat, too.  
*擁有財產的秩序。*判斷是秩序是天堂的第一定律。 思維類型出於功利性原因而相信秩序。 TJ類型的人員在他們的辦公室抽屜中可能有很多東西，它們整齊地分類在盒子中，但並不關心辦公室頂部的狀態。 FJ類型，從審美角度來看，更傾向於頂部整潔。

- *The planned life.* Order applied to one's activities means programs and schedules. The judging types decide in advance what they intend to accomplish, and they make careful and sometimes very long-range plans. FJs tend to have the fullest schedules because of their many social activities.  
*計劃壽命。*應用於某人活動的順序表示計劃和時間表。 評審類型會預先決定要完成的工作，並且會制定謹慎的計劃，有時甚至是非常長遠的計劃。 FJ由於其許多社交活動而往往擁有最充分的日程安排。
- *Sustained effort.* Having once decided to do a thing, the judging types continue to do it. This application of willpower results in impressive accomplishments. The tortoise in the race was certainly a judging type. The hare, becuase he liked to operate in tremendous spurts, was probably an extraverted intuitive but lacked adequate judgment.  
*持續努力。*一旦決定做某事，評委類型將繼續做。 意志力的這種應用取得了令人矚目的成就。 比賽中的烏龜無疑是一種判斷。 野兔，因為他喜歡突飛猛進，可能是一種外向的直覺，但缺乏足夠的判斷力。

- *Decisiveness.* Note everyone who lives in the judging attitude enjoys the actual makeing of decisions. Some simply dislike to have things remain undecided. These are more likely to be feeling types than thinkers.  
*果斷。*請注意，每個以評判態度生活的人都喜歡實際的決策。 有些人根本不喜歡讓事情變得不確定。 與思想家相比，這些人更可能是情感類型。

- *Exercise of authority.* The judging types want to see other people conform to their standards and are usually glad to advise them. The TJ people often have better executive and organizing abilities, but where the rules are firmly laid down, the FJs can be very good at gentle enforcement. Of 124 school administrators cited by von Fange (1961), 86 percent were J.  
*行使權力。*評審類型希望看到其他人符合他們的標準，並且通常很樂意為他們提供建議。 TJ人員通常具有更好的執行和組織能力，但是如果規則很牢固，FJ就會很善於輕柔地執行。 馮·範格（1961）引用的124位學校管理人員中，有86％是J。

- *Settled opinions.* Judging types usually know what they think about everything they consider worth thinking about.  
*和解意見。*評判類型通常會知道他們對所有值得考慮的事物的想法。

- *Acceptance of routine.* Acceptance of routine is put last because any marked development of intuition is apt to cancel it out, but judging types with sensing seem able to take routine more philosophically than any of the other types. Among the gifts of perception are:  
*接受例行程序。*接受例行程序是最後一次，因為直覺的任何顯著發展都傾向於將其消除，但是用感覺來判斷的類型似乎比其他任何類型的方法在哲學上都更容易接受。 感知的禮物包括：

- *Spontaneity.* Spontaneity is the ability to take whole-heartedly the experience or enlightenment of the present moment, even though  some intended thing goes undone. Perceptive types believe it can be more important to go and look at a bird's nest that the children have found, or to take time out to help hunt up the answer to a question, or listen to a confidence with one's whole heart, thatn to have a meal on time.  
*自發性。*自發性是一種能夠全心全意地吸收當前時刻的經驗或啟示的能力，即使某些預期的事情沒有完成。 有洞察力的人認為，去看孩子發現的燕窩，或者抽出時間來幫助尋找問題的答案，或者全心全意地傾聽，以擁有 準時吃飯。

- *Open-mindedness.* Perception involves a certain hospitality of mind, a willingness to admit to consideration of new facts, ideas, and proposals, even though they involve the reopening of decisions or opinions. The perceptive types leave many decisions and opinions standing wide open in expectation of new information.  
*思想開放。*感知涉及到一定的待客之道，願意接受對新事實，新思想和新提議的考慮，即使它們涉及重新開放決策或觀點。 感知類型使許多決策和觀點在期待新信息的情況下敞開。

- *Understanding.* Perception is applied to people in order to understand their point of view rather than to pass judgment on their actions. Parents who take the perceptive attitude with their children whenever possible will be entrusted with many more confidences than parents who have an immediate (and usually critical) opinion about everything they are told. The comparatively rare pronouncements of the perceptive parents will be accorded more respect,  because the parents will have done enough listening to appreciate the situation.<br>
A *generally* perceptive attitude is perfectly consistent with firm parental discipline. Discipline is needed to enforce the fundamentals, preferably a few fundamentals. If children observe those faithfully, they are acceptable members of society, and just like grown-ups, they are entitled to be spared a running commentary on their every act.  
- *了解。*感知應用於人們是為了理解他們的觀點，而不是對他們的行為做出判斷。 與那些對所告訴的一切有立即（通常是批評性的）觀點的父母相比，在任何可能的情況下對孩子採取感知態度的父母將被賦予更多的信心。 家長會做出更多的尊重，因為父母會傾聽足夠多的聲音來欣賞情況。<br>
*一般*的感知態度與堅定的父母紀律完全一致。 需要紀律來加強基本原則，最好是一些基本原則。 如果孩子們忠實地遵守這些原則，那麼他們就是社會上可以接受的成員，就像大人一樣，他們有權免於對其行為的評論。

- *Tolerance.* The "live and let live" attitude arises partly from reluctance to settle things for other people and partly from perceptive recognition that there can be a variety of legitimate standards. Tolerance grows dangerous only when carried to the extreme of condoning actual *lack* of standards in some essential field.  
*寬容。*“生與活”的態度部分源於不願為他人解決問題，部分源於對各種合法標準的敏銳認知。 只有在某些必不可少的領域中容忍標準的實際“不足”時，公差才變得危險。

- *Curiosity.* One of the liveliest gifts of the perceptive types is the expectation that what they do not yet know will be interesting. Curiosity leads them into many byways of knowledge and experience and into amassing astonishing stores of information. It also wards off boredom, as it finds something of interest in almost any situation.  
*好奇心。*這種敏銳類型最生動的禮物之一就是期望他們還不知道會變得有趣。 好奇心使他們進入許多知識和經驗的途徑，並積累了大量驚人的信息。 它還可以避免無聊，因為它幾乎可以在任何情況下找到一些有趣的東西。

- *Zest for experience.* Another expectation of the perceptives is that what they have not yet done is going to be interesting. They may refuse a new experience on grounds of taste or principle or in favor of a more compelling attraction, but seldom because it is "not worth doing," as the judging types say.  
*對經驗的熱情。*對感知器的另一個期望是，他們尚未做的事情將會變得有趣。 他們可能會出於品味或原則而拒絕新體驗，或者傾向於吸引人的吸引力，但是很少有人會因為評判類型的說法而認為“不值得這樣做”。

- *Adaptability.* The perceptive handles a difficulty by adapting the available means for the achievement of the essential ends. One very perceptive woman cherishes a compliment from her judging husband on how effectively she reassembles the fragments of a situation when something unforeseen upsets all the existing arrangements. Because she is never tied to the old plan, she is free to improvise a new one to meet the altered conditions, and enjoys doint it.   
*適應性。*感知者通過適應實現基本目的的可用手段來處理困難。 一位非常有洞察力的婦女對她的評判丈夫表示稱讚，稱她在無法預料的情況下破壞了所有現有安排的情況下，如何有效地重組了局勢的碎片。 因為她從未與舊計劃捆綁在一起，所以她可以自由地為滿足變更後的條件而臨時制定一個新計劃，並且喜歡這樣做。

In considering the qualities listed above, readers may have difficulty evaluating their own JP preference because of an inconsistency between what they feel they should do, what they actually do, and what they naturally tend to do. It is the natural tendency that reveals the basic preference. A person's idea of what is right may be an acquired ideal, borrowed from another type, and the person's actual behavior may reflect a somewhat uncongenial good habit learned from parents or accepted because of the person's own dogged efforts.  
在考慮上述質量時，讀者可能難以評估自己的JP偏好，因為他們認為應該做的事情，實際要做的事情以及他們自然傾向於做的事情之間不一致。 揭示基本偏好的是自然趨勢。 一個人對正確事物的想法可能是一種獲得的理想，是從另一種類型借鑒而來的，並且該人的實際行為可能反映出從父母那裡學到的，或者由於該人自己的頑強努力而被接受的一種不太友善的好習慣。

It is important, especially for introverts, to remember that the JP preference applies to a person's customary attitude toward the outer world. What shows in most causal contracts with other people (and governs the JP index on the Type Indicator) is the extraverted process, the one usually relied on for the conduct of outer life. For extraverts, it is the same as the dominant process; for introverts it is not.  
重要的是，特別是對於性格內向的人，要記住，JP偏好適用於一個人對外界的習慣態度。在與他人的大多數因果合同（並控制類型指示器上的JP指數）中顯示的是外向過程，通常是外在行為所依賴的過程。對於性格外向者，它與主導過程相同；對於內向的人不是。

Thus, in an introvert the preference for the judging attitude in outer matters may be quite evident, even obvious, but it not final. The judging process used in the outer world is actually subordinate to the introverted dominant process (which is a perceptive one) and operates subject to the requirements of that favorite perceptive process. For example, if thinking is the extraverted process, it will conduct things with logic and decisiveness, but logic will not be allowed to hamper the inner perception.  
因此，在內向性方面，對外部事務的判斷態度的偏愛可能是顯而易見的，甚至是顯而易見的，但不是最終的。外部世界中使用的判斷過程實際上服從內向的主導過程（這是一種感知的過程），並且受制於該喜歡的感知過程的要求。例如，如果思維是外向的過程，它將以邏輯和決定性的方式進行事情，但是邏輯將不被允許妨礙內在的感知。

Similarly, in an introvert whose preference for the perceptive attitude is ordinarily obvious, this perceptiveness is actually subordinate to an introverted judging process (thinking or feeling) and must serve the ultimate values and principles determined by the judging process. A very perceptive introvert student was surprised when she was voted "most decisive" in her high school class. The vote was taken soon after several issues had arisen that touched feeling values she held fundamental.  Her inner certainty had overruled her habitual outer perceptiveness, and she had defended her position on all the issues.  
類似地，在一個內向的人通常對感知態度的偏愛中，這種感知實際上是服從內向的判斷過程（思考或感覺），並且必須服務於判斷過程所確定的最終價值和原則。當一個高瞻遠矚的性格內向的學生在高中班被評選為“最具決定性”時，她感到驚訝。在出現了幾項觸及她所持有的基本價值觀的問題之後，不久就進行了投票。她內在的確定性否定了她慣常的外在感知力，她為所有問題辯護。

Some differences resulting from the JP preference are compared in Figure 27. In general, these characteristics differentiate extraverts in the bottom row of the Type Table from those in the third row. They also differentiate introverts in the top row from those in the second row, with certain exceptions due to the special role of the introvert's dominant process.  
在圖-27中比較了由JP偏好引起的一些差異。通常，這些特徵將類型表底部行中的外向型與第三行中的外向型區分開。他們還將上排的內向型人與第二排的內向型人區分開，但由於內向型人的主導性過程具有特殊作用，因此有一些例外。

| Aim to be right. | Aim to miss nothing. |
| Are self-regimented, purposeful, and exacting. | Are flexible, adaptable, and tolerant. |
