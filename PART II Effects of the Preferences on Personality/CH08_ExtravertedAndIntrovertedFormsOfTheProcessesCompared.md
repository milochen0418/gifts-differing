## Chapter 8  
# Extraverted and Introverted forms of the Processes Compared 外傾與內傾的對比  

THE EFFECT OF echof four preferences -- between introversion and extraversion, between sensing and intuiting, between thinking and feeling, and between judging and perceiving --have been discussed in the preceding chapters. *In combination*, the four preferences determine type, but the traits that result from each preference do not combine to influence and individual's personality by simple *addition* of characteristics; instread, the traits result from the interaction of the prefernces.  

The effect of the interaction  of the preferred processes is made apparent when the extraverted form of a particular process -- thinking, feeling, sensing, or intuition -- is compared with the introverted form of the same process. The four figures that make up the balance of this chapter, Figures 28-31, present contrasting pairs of sentences describing the extraverte and introverted forms of thinking, feeling, sensing, and intuition. The comparisons presented in the figures, which were drawn by Katharine C. Briggs during her initial study of *Psychological Type*, include the effects of extraversion and introversion on the kinds of information a particular process uses or suppresses; the strengths, the weaknesses, and the goals of the four processes discussed; how each of the processes expresses itself; and so on.

| **Extraverted Thinking** | **Introverted Thinking** |
| ----- | ----- |
| Is fed from objective data -- facts and borrowed ideas.  | Is fed from subjective and unconscious roots -- archetypes. | 
| Depends upon the facts of experience and regards the abstract idea as unsubstantial and of negligible importance. | Depends upon the abstract ide as the decisive factor, and values facts chiefly as illustrative proofs of the idea. |
| Relies on facts outside of the thinker, which are more decisive than the thinking itself, for soundness and value. | Relies on the thinker's powers of observation and appreciation and use of the inner wealth of inherited experience for soundness and value. |
| Has as its goal the solution of practical problems, discovery and classification of facts, criticism and modification of generally accepted ideas, planning of programs, and developoing of formulas. | Has as its goal formulating questions, creating theories, opening up prospects, yielding insight, and finally, seeing how external facts fit into the framework of the idea or theory it has created. |
| Dwells upon the details of the concrete case, including irrelevancies. | Seizes upon the similarities of the concrete case, dismissing irrelevancies. |
| Has tendency to multiply facts until their meaning is smothered and thinking paralyzed. | Has a tendency to  neglect facts or to coerce them into agreement with the idea, selecting only those that support the idea. |
| Consists of a succession of concrete representations that are set in motion not so much by an inner thought activity as by the changing stream of sense perceptions. | Consists of an inner though activity, tied loosely if at all  to the stream of sense impressions, which are dimmed by the vividness of the stream of inner impressions. |
