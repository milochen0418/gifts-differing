## Chapter 8  
# Extraverted and Introverted forms of the Processes Compared 外傾與內傾的對比  

THE EFFECT OF echof four preferences -- between introversion and extraversion, between sensing and intuiting, between thinking and feeling, and between judging and perceiving --have been discussed in the preceding chapters. *In combination*, the four preferences determine type, but the traits that result from each preference do not combine to influence and individual's personality by simple *addition* of characteristics; instread, the traits result from the interaction of the prefernces.  

The effect of the interaction  of the preferred processes is made apparent when the extraverted form of a particular process -- thinking, feeling, sensing, or intuition -- is compared with the introverted form of the same process. The four figures that make up the balance of this chapter, Figures 28-31, present contrasting pairs of sentences describing the extraverte and introverted forms of thinking, feeling, sensing, and intuition. The comparisons presented in the figures, which were drawn by Katharine C. Briggs during her initial study of *Psychological Type*, include the effects of extraversion and introversion on the kinds of information a particular process uses or suppresses; the strengths, the weaknesses, and the goals of the four processes discussed; how each of the processes expresses itself; and so on.  


------------------
| **Extraverted Thinking** | **Introverted Thinking** |
| ----- | ----- |
| Is fed from objective data -- facts and borrowed ideas.  | Is fed from subjective and unconscious roots -- archetypes. | 
| Depends upon the facts of experience and regards the abstract idea as unsubstantial and of negligible importance. | Depends upon the abstract ide as the decisive factor, and values facts chiefly as illustrative proofs of the idea. |
| Relies on facts outside of the thinker, which are more decisive than the thinking itself, for soundness and value. | Relies on the thinker's powers of observation and appreciation and use of the inner wealth of inherited experience for soundness and value. |
| Has as its goal the solution of practical problems, discovery and classification of facts, criticism and modification of generally accepted ideas, planning of programs, and developoing of formulas. | Has as its goal formulating questions, creating theories, opening up prospects, yielding insight, and finally, seeing how external facts fit into the framework of the idea or theory it has created. |
| Dwells upon the details of the concrete case, including irrelevancies. | Seizes upon the similarities of the concrete case, dismissing irrelevancies. |
| Has tendency to multiply facts until their meaning is smothered and thinking paralyzed. | Has a tendency to  neglect facts or to coerce them into agreement with the idea, selecting only those that support the idea. |
| Consists of a succession of concrete representations that are set in motion not so much by an inner thought activity as by the changing stream of sense perceptions. | Consists of an inner though activity, tied loosely if at all  to the stream of sense impressions, which are dimmed by the vividness of the stream of inner impressions. |

| **Extraverted Feeling** | **Introverted Feeling** |
| ----- | ----- |
| Is determined chiefly by the objective factor and serves to make the individual feel correctly, that is, conventionally, under all circumstances. | Is determined chiefly by the subjective factor and serves as a guide to the emotional acceptance or rejection of various aspects of life. | 
| Adapts the individual to the objective situation. | Adapts the objective situation to the individual by the simple process of excluding or ignoring the unacceptable. |
| Depends wholly upon the ideals, conventions, and customs of the environment, and is extensive rather than deep. | Depends upon abstract feeling -- ideals such as love, patriotism, religion, and loyalty, and is deep and passionate rather than extensive. |
| Finds soundness and value outside of the individual in the collective ideals of the community,  which are usually accepted without question | Finds soundness and value inside one's self from one's own inner wealth and powers of appreciation and abstraction. |
| Has as its goal the formation and maintenance of easy and harmonious emotional relationships with other people. | Has as its goal the fostering and protection  of an intense inner emotional life, and, so far as possible, the outer fulfillment and realization of the inner ideal. |
| Expresses itself easily and so shares itself with others, creating and arousing similar feeling and establishing warm sympathy and understanding | May be too overpowering to be expressed at all, creating a false appearance of coldness to the point of indifference, and may be completely misunderstood. |
| Has a tendency to suppress the personal standpoint entirely, and presents the danger of becoming a feeling personality, giving the effect of insincerity and pose. | Has a tendency to find no objective fulfillment or realization -- or outlet -- for expression, and presents the danger of living upon sentiment, illusion, and self-pity. |
