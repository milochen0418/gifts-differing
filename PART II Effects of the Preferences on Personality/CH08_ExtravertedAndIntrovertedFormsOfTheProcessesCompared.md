## Chapter 8  
# Extraverted and Introverted forms of the Processes Compared 外傾與內傾的對比  

THE EFFECT OF echof four preferences -- between introversion and extraversion, between sensing and intuiting, between thinking and feeling, and between judging and perceiving --have been discussed in the preceding chapters. *In combination*, the four preferences determine type, but the traits that result from each preference do not combine to influence and individual's personality by simple *addition* of characteristics; instread, the traits result from the interaction of the prefernces.  

The effect of the interaction  of the preferred processes is made apparent when the extraverted form of a particular process -- thinking, feeling, sensing, or intuition -- is compared with the introverted form of the same process. The four figures that make up the balance of this chapter, Figures 28-31, present contrasting pairs of sentences describing the extraverte and introverted forms of thinking, feeling, sensing, and intuition. The comparisons presented in the figures, which were drawn by Katharine C. Briggs during her initial study of *Psychological Type*, include the effects of extraversion and introversion on the kinds of information a particular process uses or suppresses; the strengths, the weaknesses, and the goals of the four processes discussed; how each of the processes expresses itself; and so on.
